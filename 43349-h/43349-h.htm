<p>Thans kregen we de avonturen van O&rsquo;Neill te hooren
op een auto-tochtje, waarbij hij te gast gaat bij een vriendelijke
boerenfamilie. O&rsquo;Neill heeft razenden honger, maar
tot zijn onuitsprekelijke verbazing krijgt hij niets te eten,
ofschoon hij toch op elk vriendelijk aanbod even vriendelijk
antwoordt: &ldquo;dank u wel&rdquo;, hierbij een getrouwe
vertaling gevend van &rsquo;t Engelsche: &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;, zonder
echter &rsquo;t verschil in beteekenis van beide uitdrukkingen

<p class="center"><i>Dear Cuey-na-Gael</i>,</p>

<p>Thank you ever so much for the pleasure you
gave me by sending me the account of your friend
O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s experiences in our country.</p>

<p>It is excellent fun and the whole thing is full
of quiet humour.</p>

<p>It cannot but be highly appreciated by all Dutch
people who are trying to master the difficulties of
English, and often despair of finding the right word
for the right place. To all such it will be quite a
treat to see how their vernacular puzzled your fellow-countryman.</p>

<p>The booklet fully deserves a place in the libraries
of our H.&nbsp;B. Schools and Gymnasiums, and is sure
to find one there.</p>

<p>Wishing you all possible success with your publication,</p>

<small>O&rsquo;NEILL&rsquo;S GREAT PLANS.</small></h2>


<p>We were seated one November evening in
O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s rooms in Trinity College Dublin when the
conversation turned on modern languages.</p>

<p>Each had his own story to tell, but we waited
in vain for our host to unbosom himself on the
subject of Dutch. Yet he was understood to have
had thrilling experiences in the Hague in August.</p>

<p>By a few gentle hints we endeavoured to
elicit from him some talk about his linguistic
adventures, and, not succeeding very well, I at last
asked him point-blank if he didn&rsquo;t find Dutch
hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, said O&rsquo;Neill promptly, in answer to my
question. &ldquo;Yes: it certainly <em>is</em> hard!&rdquo; he repeated,
as he balanced the poker, preparatory to smashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the biggest piece of coal on the fire. &ldquo;Why the
whole thing&rsquo;s next to impossible!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">O&rsquo;NEILL&rsquo;S GREAT PLANS.</div>

<p>There was something in his tone that sounded
promising. He had a grievance evidently against
the language; and there was a sufficient amount
of suppressed irritation in his voice to indicate
that there might be entertaining disclosures at
hand.</p>

<p>Jack O&rsquo;Neill had worked too closely at his
mathematics the winter before, and had taken a
long holiday in summer. A month of this he had
spent in Holland to master the Dutch language, he
said, and get a good general acquaintance with Dutch
Literature. These had been great plans, and we were
naturally eager to learn how they had succeeded.
We had seen, however, very little of Jack since
his return, as he had been most of the time at his
aunt&rsquo;s place in Connemara. Now that he was back
at Trinity safe and sound, we naturally expected to
get the news sooner or later. The conditions were
so favourable that evening for a talker to spin his
yarn, that we were all impatience for Jack to begin.
We settled ourselves comfortably to listen; but he
did not seem in a hurry to unfold this particular tale.</p>

<p>We had already heard from him a great deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
about William the Silent, and more than a great
deal about Dutch art, but not a word about the
Dutch language.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HUNTING IDIOMS IN THE DARK.</div>

<p>Our next-door neighbours, the &ldquo;Professor&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;Philosopher&rdquo;&mdash;two students from the Cape
who were working for their degree&mdash;were as interested
as I was, in O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s Dutch, and they
used to drop in to hear what was going on.</p>

<p>It was the third evening they had called; and
as it was clear that Jack was somewhat reticent
about his &ldquo;linguistics&rdquo;, we had to guide him gently
to the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I said again. &ldquo;<em>You</em> had no difficulty.
You made yourself understood from the
first. You wrote me that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jack, sitting bolt upright, &ldquo;I know
better now; and I stopped talking Dutch when
I began to understand myself. You have to
hunt in the dark,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;to catch the
exact word or the proper idiom&mdash;and a man
likes to know what he is talking about, himself.
The language isn&rsquo;t child&rsquo;s play, that&rsquo;s the truth.
But it&rsquo;s a fine country. You should see the
light when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">O&rsquo;NEILL&rsquo;S GREAT PLANS.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Philosopher, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
hear any more about the country. Please not. We
know all about those azure heavens and the
infinite horizons and the scrumbled distances and
the Rembrandt cattle, and all that. Why, man, I&rsquo;ll
undertake to draw from your own rhapsodies about
those pictures an absolutely correct copy of (say)
Paul Potter&rsquo;s &lsquo;Night Watch&rsquo;, or van der Helst&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Anatomy Lesson&rsquo;, or Mesdag&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lost-Chord&rsquo;, and the
canals and the clouds and the chiaro-oscuro. You
needn&rsquo;t go over them again&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought&rdquo;, piped the First year&rsquo;s man,
who always came in with the Professor and never
quite comprehended what was going on, &ldquo;I thought
that the &lsquo;Night Watch&rsquo; was not by Paul Potter. Surely
the &lsquo;Night Watch&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Anatomy Lesson&rsquo; are
two well-known pictures by Remb&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Never
mind what you thought!&rdquo; interrupted the Professor.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think, it&rsquo;s bad for your constitution. And
above all things don&rsquo;t try to be accurate, or you&rsquo;ll
get yourself into trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Philosopher&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;Our minds
are a chaos after O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s descriptions. We&rsquo;ll only
pardon you, Jack, all that golden haze and the
Rembrandts, if you condescend to plain facts. Tell
us now about your Dutch. Do. We&rsquo;re absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
thirsting for an account of your adventures. Or
were you too timid to embark on the open sea
of the <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">taal</em>, sticking cravenly to English all the
time? Why I thought you had more <em>go</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">MASTERING DUTCH IN A FORTNIGHT.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Neill promised to master the language
in the first fortnight&rdquo;, chimed in the First Year&rsquo;s
man in his high boyish voice, &ldquo;and to finish the
principal Dutch classics in the second fortnight.
Those were his very words.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br /><br />

<small>GRAMMAR AND PHRASE BOOK.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Well&rdquo;, said O&rsquo;Neill with a kind of sickly
smile, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get so very much time, you see,
either for the Literature or for the Language.
Of course there was much sight-seeing, and&mdash;I
spent a good deal of time over the pictures,
which&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Philosopher shut his eyes, heaved an audible
sigh, but said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&rdquo;, continued Jack hastily without seeming
to notice the interruption, &ldquo;my efforts to speak
Dutch were not always appreciated&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said the First Year&rsquo;s man, with
sudden interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on&rdquo;, said the Professor, &ldquo;now you&rsquo;re
started&rdquo;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">JA AND NEEN.</div>

<p>&ldquo;You soon left your hotel for lodgings?&rdquo; I
added enquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;I was afraid I&rsquo;d
never pick up the language. There is no chance of
practice unless you get away from everybody that
speaks English. That was not too easy, I tell you.
But Enderby helped me, and we searched about
the Hague for two whole days. At last we found
perfectly charming rooms opposite a canal; the landlady
didn&rsquo;t know a word of English. She knew
Dutch, though, all right. Fluent, did you say?
I should think she was. A perfect marvel. No need
of the dictionary, you know.&mdash;Verbs all in their
proper places&mdash;and plenty of them!</p>

<div class="sidenote">WILL YOU BITE?</div>

<p>Enderby told her all I required, and then went
away. It was like being thrown into the sea, as you
may guess; but I imagined I should soon learn to
swim. There&rsquo;s nothing like being cast completely
on your own resources, they say. Still it was a bit
awkward at coffee-time, when the landlady came
up and talked. She poured forth a rapid and resistless
stream of friendly Dutch upon me, while I
nodded in the intervals and tried to think. It was
a very one-sided business. I was very hungry, too,
and wanted luncheon. Now there was abundance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
this unequal kind of conversation, but no lunch in
sight, so I&mdash;(remember I knew only <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ja</span> and <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">neen</span>,
and was not very sure of them, either)&mdash;I just
pointed gracefully to my lips to indicate that I
needed food. That produced an immediate effect&mdash;a
torrent of eloquence forcibly delivered and
ending with some enquiry about <em>biting</em>!</p>

<p>I shook my head and said &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Neen, neen!</span> You
put it too crudely&mdash;luncheon&mdash;eat&mdash;eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">O ja</span>,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">best. Eten&mdash;eten om
vijf uur&mdash;vijf.</span>&rdquo; And she held out one hand
with the fingers spread. It seemed to me she was
swearing there was enough food in the house to
satisfy a hungry Irishman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good&mdash;so far,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, ja!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">En mynheer wil niet ontbijten?</span>&rdquo; she rejoined.
This was the <em>biting</em> again, so I said decidedly,
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Neen; niet bijte</span>&rdquo;. She seemed surprised and a
little hurt, but she said nothing and went away.
And of course I had to fast until five o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>This would never do, I felt; and that evening
I bought the first grammar and dictionary I could
lay my hands on at a second-hand bookstall in the
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Binnenhof</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PURCHASE OF THE BOOKS.</div>

<p>They were antique looking volumes, most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
them there; and my books had a remarkably
ancient aspect. But I was glad to find that I had
completed the purchase of them without using one
word of English. How? Oh, the method&rsquo;s very
simple. You pick out some big book you don&rsquo;t
want, and hold it up interrogatively.</p>

<p>You <em>can</em> hold up a book interrogatively, you know,
with a little practice. Well, you lift some rubbishy,
bulky volume that you wouldn&rsquo;t be paid to put in
your library, and you give it a sort of enquiring
wave in front of the vendor of these second-hand
goods, and the vendor immediately understands
your picturesque query to be &ldquo;How much?&rdquo; He
answers promptly, and you as promptly drop the
rubbishy fat volume, as if it was a scorpion: you
sigh resignedly, raise your eyebrows and walk away
disgusted.</p>

<p>That is the first step. That is to give him respect
for your intelligence and to indicate your willingness
to negociate on reasonable terms.</p>

<p>The next step is different. You linger with an
air of disdain at the tail-end of the bookstall; and,
as an after-thought&mdash;just as you are moving off&mdash;you
halt a moment and flick the particular work you
do happen to want, with a careless forefinger or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
point of your walking-stick. At once the man talks,
and you say &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nee</span>&rdquo;.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PURCHASE OF THE BOOKS.</div>

<p>He talks more. You say, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Neen, neen</span>&rdquo; and
shake your head sadly. He talks still more, and
gesticulates excitedly with the book in his hand. You
wait till he stops for breath, then suddenly interject,
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja; best</span>,&rdquo; taking care to put down a large silver
coin,&mdash;and the article is yours! The negotiation
is over; and all you have to do is to gather up
your purchase and a quantity of small silver and
copper coins that you get as change. Then with a
little patience at home and some arithmetic you
can count out&mdash;approximately&mdash;how much the
things have cost you. That&rsquo;s the way you buy
second-hand books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had no idea, Jack, you had such a genius for
diplomacy,&rdquo; I murmured, as O&rsquo;Neill evidently expected
us to say something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or for finance,&rdquo; added the First Year&rsquo;s Man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did your medieval purchases do all for you that
you expected?&rdquo; enquired the Philosopher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, hardly,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After my first success I somewhat underestimated
the difficulties of the idiom. But I worked hard at
the grammar.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A LITERARY FIND.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! a Grammar?&rdquo; interrupted the Professor.
&ldquo;Did you say you acquired a Grammar? I am
interested. Could you manage to describe those
volumes now, if it&rsquo;s not too great a strain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the books!&rdquo; resumed O&rsquo;Neill. &ldquo;Well&mdash;there
was a little fat Dictionary, closely printed,
with Dutch into English and English into Dutch;
and there was a handsome new Phrase-book in
brilliant colours, containing conversations on the
most unlikely topics. But I admit the Grammar
Exercise-book was the gem of the collection. It
was printed on a kind of dusky paper, something
like blot-sheet, and it bore the date 1807. It had
six hundred and thirty-one exercises, double ones,
Dutch into English and English into Dutch&mdash;and
contained many idioms, hints, exceptions, and explanations.
In warnings, foot-notes, and asterisks it was
particularly rich. Not a few pages were ornamented
with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nota Bene&rsquo;s</i> of various brands, with hands,
large and small, drawing attention to them. The
English of this manual was very odd, and by and
by I got the impression that the Dutch was rather
shaky too. Not that I guessed this at first, you
may be sure; but it gradually dawned upon me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A PLENTIFUL HARVEST.</div>

<p>I took a certain pride in my treasures, and set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
about studying them with zeal. No doubt it was
disappointing just at the beginning to read: <em>Nota
Bene&mdash;No one but a Dutchman can emit this
sound</em>; or this: &ldquo;N.&nbsp;B. *.*.*. <em>This sound must
be heard.</em> It is <em>something like U</em> but cannot
be otherwise described. It cannot be represented
by any known letters. Foreigners need not try it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I skipped over these obstacles, mastered the
verbs &lsquo;to be&rsquo; and &lsquo;to have&rsquo;, in their elements, got
an idea of the way to construct plurals and diminutives,
and went to sleep content.</p>

<p>Next morning after breakfast&mdash;which by the
bye came up all right, without any special effort
on my part&mdash;, remembering that I needed pens
and ink I determined to go out and buy them
myself.</p>

<div class="lft">

</div>

<p>That is all I seemed to require.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HURDLES.</div>

<p><i>Have you?</i> Well; that is not so simple as it
looks. I consulted the Grammar and was appalled
to see the amazing variety of choice afforded to
any one in Holland who contemplated asking this
innocent question.</p>

<p>I looked carefully at this curious form. Yes,
wherever it occurred, there were marks of parenthesis
tied round the (<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">lieden</span>). How was I to pronounce
those brackets? The vowels and the usual
consonants I had learnt already were very trying.
But what about those marks? Did they denote a
cough, or a sneeze or gentlemanly tap of your foot
on the ground? On the whole I thought I should
best represent them by two graceful waves of the
hand&mdash;one for each bracket.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE VERB OF THE SEASON.</div>

<p>I counted them over. There are twelve ways of
saying <i>Have you</i> in Dutch. That was distinctly
suggestive, it seemed to me at the first brush, of
the twelve months of the year. You could begin
in January with <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hebt gij</span>, in February you would
have <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hebt ge</span>, and so you could work on through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the months, keeping your grammar and your chronology
going, side by side, through the seasons till
you would emerge safely near Christmas with <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Heb
jelui.</span> This theory was not without its attractions.
But what would happen in passing, say, from June
to July, if you forgot what day of the month it
was? If it was July the first and you imagined it
was June the thirtieth, you would be talking bad
grammar! No: that would never do. My brilliant
conjecture had soon to be abandoned as fanciful,
and I was very sorry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TWELVE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC.</div>

<p>But the facts of the case were dead against the
obvious chronological arrangement, though they were
by no means easily grasped. There were asterisks
and foot-notes to all these zodiacal forms; and a
great deal of solid reading had to be gone through
before you got at the relative force of any particular
term. The erudition was distracting, and the warnings
were positively alarming, but after much
painstaking investigation I seemed to perceive three
grand principles emerging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; we all said together, as O&rsquo;Neill paused
for breath. &ldquo;And these were?&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; resumed Jack deliberately,
checking off the principles upon his fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THREE PRINCIPLES.</div>

<p>I. &ldquo;Never say <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">je</span> or <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">jij</span> to a man unless you
mean to insult him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. In the second place, <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">je</span> and <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">jij</span> may be freely
used on all occasions, if you only know how.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&rdquo;, said the First Year&rsquo;s Man, &ldquo;you just
said that...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued O&rsquo;Neill firmly, not heeding
the interruption, &ldquo;and you may use the Third
Person of the verb for the Second and the Second
for the Third; and you may use a Plural for a
Singular and a Singular for a Plural; and you may
use <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">U</span> for <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">UE</span>, and <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">UE</span> for <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">UEdele</span>; you use <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">jij</span>
for <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">je</span>, and <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">je</span> for <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ge</span>, and <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ge</span> for <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">gij</span>, and you use
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">jullie</span> for <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">gy(lieden)</span> with brackets round the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">lieden</span>;
but no one now ever does say <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">gy(lieden)</span> with
brackets round the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">lieden</span>, except in poetry; and
nobody in any circumstances ever uses <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">UEdele</span>
except when dining with members of the Royal
Family. Then you are allowed to utter this vocable
once, and must maintain a discreet silence during the
rest of the repast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you get all that rubbish?&rdquo; I asked
in disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boyton and Brandnetel&rdquo;, he answered glibly,
&ldquo;page 52.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;At least&rdquo;, he added, &ldquo;it was something like
that. That gives you a good general idea of the
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you are quite done with Boyton,&rdquo; said
the Professor slowly, &ldquo;when your education&rsquo;s finished,
you know, I&rsquo;ll make you a reasonably high offer
for that book. Boyton would relieve the tedium of
my philological studies, I can see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; interposed the First Year Incorrigible,
&ldquo;perhaps Mr. O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s accuracy was all used
up in his Artistic Studies. That would leave none
for the grammar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice way to put it,&rdquo; said the Philosopher.
&ldquo;Please curb your imagination, O&rsquo;Neill;
stick as near to probability as you can&mdash;without
too great pain to yourself&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll not be hard
upon you. Wasn&rsquo;t there a third clear principle that
emerged in the course of your investigations?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&rdquo;, said O&rsquo;Neill with some show of caution.
&ldquo;As nearly as I can remember, it was this:</p>

<p>III. Never say <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">jou</span>; and avoid <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">UE</span> except in correspondence.
You are warned against any approach
to familiarity in the use of pronouns. The courteous
form is <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">UEdele</span>. <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Gij</span> more respectful than
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">jij</span>. <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Je</span> is a term of endearment.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A WARNING NOTE.</div>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; objected the First Year&rsquo;s Man, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t
seem to hang together, for you said just now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No debating allowed,&rdquo; growled the Philosopher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, O&rsquo;Neill, with those general principles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all of them,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;all at
present.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, to resume my story, I picked out
the most harmless of the <i>have you&rsquo;s</i>, and was
proceeding to work out the formula for &lsquo;Have you
pens,&rsquo; when to my consternation my eye fell on a
dreadful warning, a kind of threat.</p>

<p><i>N.B. Important!&mdash;The foreigner is distinctly
given to understand that he must commit to memory
some polite phrases before engaging in conversation
(see page 201) and study the chief sentences of a
good phrase book. All pronouns savouring of familiarity
are to be carefully avoided.</i></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br /><br />

<small>THE RECITATIONS IN THE WOOD.</small></h2>


<p>You may be sure that made me rather diffident
till I had mastered some of these &lsquo;polite phrases&rsquo;.
Polite they were, and no mistake&mdash;why French
was nothing to it!&mdash;and I got the very nicest
of them well into my head. I went round to
Enderby&rsquo;s, and he put me on the way of pronouncing
the words. Then I took a whole morning
in <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het Bosch</span> and recited them to myself
aloud. When no one was in sight I allowed myself
some freedom of utterance; and once I thought
I must have startled with my <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ore rotundo</i> an
artist who was plying his harmless calling unseen
behind a clump of trees. At least some one retired
very hastily after I had delivered, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Doe zooveel
moeite niet</span>&rdquo;, three times with a vigorous rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
inflection and four times with the falling inflection,
followed in each case by the rhetorical pause. From the
deserted easel I judged it must have been an artist. He
withdrew at a good pace, and never once looked back.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A SUSPICIOUS POLICEMAN.</div>

<p>These and similar polite idioms I repeated
over some hundreds of times, till I knew them
backwards and forwards and every way, and could
have rattled them off in my sleep. Then there
was some difficulty in avoiding the policemen in
the wood. They kept prowling about after I had
incautiously experimented on the first one with,
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mynheer! ik wensch U goeden morgen; ik hoop
dat ik U niet stoor. Vaarwel.</span>&rdquo; He had looked
amazed at this; so, as a parting shot&mdash;a sort
of courteous Good Bye&mdash;I added gaily, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik bid
U maak geen complimenten.</span>&rdquo; It was this that made
the trouble, as he looked distinctly displeased, not
to say suspicious. When he heard the words first,
he had stood speechless, transfixed. Then he followed
me home and hung about the street&mdash;I
could see him from my window&mdash;for over half
an hour. I feared my pronouns had been too familiar,
though I couldn&rsquo;t see how to change them,
for there they were in the book. On the whole
I concluded I had been a trifle abrupt, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
renewed vigour I set to and committed a host of
apologetic phrases such as: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik bid U verschoon
mij. Duizendmaal vergiffenis. Het heeft niets te beduiden.</span>&rdquo;
A pretty little triplet caught my ear and
I took rather a fancy to it: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het geeft niets&mdash;het
hindert niet&mdash;het komt er niet op aan.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">DUIZENDMAAL VERGIFFENIS.</div>

<p>It was a little puzzling to disentangle some of
the courteous introductions from the sentences in
which they stood; and occasionally I committed to
memory somewhat more than I needed. This was
the case with a sentence that greatly took my
fancy. It was an apology to an imaginary gentleman
in a tram-car for having trodden on his foot.
It seemed odd to provide yourself so soon for such
contingency; but of course the book knew best.
Well, from constantly seeing the two parts of this
sentence together I got into the way mechanically
of associating the one phrase with the other. Thus
when repeating that engaging expression &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Duizendmaal
vergiffenis</span>&rdquo;, I was accustomed to follow it
up by, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">dat ik op Uw teen heb getrapt</span>,&rdquo; either
in my own mind or audibly, for the sake of practice.
From the first this polite sentence was a great
favourite of mine, and I was soon able to repeat
it with the utmost fluency and ease. So well did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
I know it, indeed, after two day&rsquo;s practice that I
was tempted to seek occasion for its use, and in
getting into the tram-car. I was half disposed to
brush, accidentally, against any object in the way
for the sake of working off my courteous apology.
But that sort of thing has unexpected consequences;
and I came to the conclusion that it is more philosophic
to learn too little than to learn too much.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ne quid nimis</span>, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">DAT IK OP UW TEEN HEB GETRAPT.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, leave metaphysics to me,&rdquo; said the Philosopher,
&ldquo;and go on with your story. You wanted
to buy pens? Did you get them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at first,&rdquo; answered O&rsquo; Neill shamefacedly,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll tell you about it&rdquo;.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br /><br />

<small>THE PURCHASE OF THE PENS.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;And what&rdquo;, said I, &ldquo;might be the particular
difficulty of saying <em>pens</em> in Dutch? You had a
dictionary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dictionary indeed!&rdquo; retorted O&rsquo;Neill with some
heat. &ldquo;Commend me to a dictionary for leading
you astray.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE VALUE OF DIMINUTIVES.</div>

<p>There was a penholder in the room, so what I
needed was only nibs. Having already with much
pain made my selection among the <em>have you&rsquo;s</em>,
I now looked up <em>nib</em> in the dictionary. Nib was
represented by five words, three of which seemed
likely enough to be right, i. e. <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">neb</i>, <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">punt</i>, and
<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">snavel</i>. Accordingly I wrote these down and worked
out their plurals and diminutives. The doubtful
ones I kept in reserve. Why did I fancy diminutives?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Oh, the grammar put me on the way of finding
them, and I got quite partial to their use. It is
such a comfort, you know, they are all neuter.
You can put <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">het</i> in front of one, and then it&rsquo;s
safe for nominative or accusative, wherever it drops
in the sentence.</p>

<p>Thus armed for the fray, and confiding in my
grammar and dictionary, I sallied forth to buy
those nibs.</p>

<p>There was no use in going to a large shop, for
experience had taught me I should at once be
accosted there in English; so I wandered about
till I discovered a kind of small general warehouse
in an obscure street. Making sure, by a careful
inspection from without, that pens were among
the commodities sold in this place, I muttered a
polite phrase or two below my breath, cleared
my throat, and entered boldly. There was a big
good-natured man reading behind the counter. No
one else was in the shop. The circumstances simply
couldn&rsquo;t be more propitious for beginning the difficult
art of Dutch conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mynheer!</span>&rdquo; said the big man, putting down
the newspaper and looking at me amiably over his
spectacles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">NEBBETJES.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mynheer!</span>&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik wensch U goeden
morgen.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the momentary pause that I was obliged to
make, to get my polite phrase properly by the end,
he rose up and said in an encouraging, friendly
manner, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wat wou Mynheer?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mynheer</span>&rdquo;, I returned, confident in the correctness
of phrase number two, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mag ik U beleefd
verzoeken mij mede te deelen, verkoopt jullie nebben&mdash;of
nebs?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>He eyed me steadily for half a minute and then
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Blief?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Blief</span>&rdquo; too.</p>

<p>But I had to go over it again. He shook his
head: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nebs&mdash;Nebs? Wat bedoelt Mynheer?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Heeft UE nebs,&mdash;of nebben?</span>&rdquo; I said&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">of
nebbetjes?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last variations were of my own invention,
thrown out as suggestions merely in order to make
sure of catching the correct plural. The Grammar&mdash;Boyton,
you know&mdash;had been strong on
diminutives; hence I thought &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">nebbetjes</span>&rdquo; might
make things clear. Apparently it did, for a deep
voice at my elbow said, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Voor paling</span>&rdquo;, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
turned round to see a red-faced sailor with rings
in his ears, nodding and smiling. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, ja, ik weet
het wel</span>,&rdquo; he said to the shopman; &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mynheer gaat
visschen</span>,&rdquo; adding confidentially for my benefit,
&ldquo;Engelsman always feesh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before I had made out what this friendly mariner
wanted to be at, the shopman had produced a
tiny fishing-rod and tackle, which he planted down
before me with an air of triumph, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Als &rsquo;t U blieft,
Mynheer!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">POENTEKENS.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Neen&mdash;Ik bid U</span>&rdquo;&mdash;I explained, grasping
for my manuscript. A glance at the document told
me that the next word for nib was <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">punt</i>, plural
probably &ldquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">punten</i>&rdquo;, pronunciation doubtful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mynheer</span>&rdquo;, I said, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">zou U zoo goed willen
wezen my te zeggen.... verkoopt UE poenten?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wat zegt U, Mynheer?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I explained &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Zou U zoo goed willen zijn mij beleefd
te zeggen en te verwittigen, verkoopt UEdele
poenten of poentekens?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I put in the &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">UEdele</span>&rdquo; once, you see, to propitiate
the shopman, who was growing flurried, as
the shop was beginning now to fill with customers.
He didn&rsquo;t seem, however, more than half pleased at
being called &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">UEdele</span>&rdquo;; so I determined to give him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
another pronoun next time&mdash;there was plenty of
choice without touching on the despised &ldquo;jy.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">A <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">STUMPER</span>.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik bid U verschoon my!.... Mag ik beleefd
verzoeken, verkoopt gy (lieden) spitsen?</span>&rdquo; When I came
to the brackets of the (<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">lieden</span>) I expressed them
vaguely by a graceful sweep of both hands.</p>

<p>No; he shrugged his shoulders in good-natured
perplexity; he didn&rsquo;t understand; and indeed my
rendering of the (<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">lieden</span>) may have confused him.</p>

<p>Then in dumb show I wrote with an imaginary
pen on an imaginary piece of paper, saying very
distinctly, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">poent!</span>&rdquo; &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">spits!</span>&rdquo; &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">poent!</span>&rdquo; A light
seemed suddenly to dawn upon him; he went to a
drawer and brought out crayons and pencils, and
reached me a stumper,&mdash;one of those soft pointed
things for rubbing in mountains and clouds, on a
pencil sketch. It was such a surprise after the fishing
rod that I involuntarily exclaimed, &ldquo;Hallo! a
stumper!&rdquo; Well, as that harmless English term
seemed to ruffle him somewhat, I hurried to my
next word. This word by the way I had written
twice, having misspelled it the first time. Now as
I stooped down to make it out, my nautical friend,
whose interest in me had never flagged, read it
before me: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Swavel! mynheer wou swavel.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">SNAVEL&mdash;<span xml:lang="en" lang="en">NOT</span> SWAVEL.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hoeveel?</span>&rdquo; said the shopman impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Voor dit</span>,&rdquo; I replied, putting down a five-penny
piece.</p>

<p>He mumbled something about <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">swavel</span> to a message-boy,
who forthwith left the shop; and I sat down
to wait. It was a vast relief to cease speaking Dutch
for a few minutes; and yet I felt uneasily conscious
that there was a mistake somewhere. The shop was
filled with pens, so that if I was really buying
pens now&mdash;as I hoped I was&mdash;there was no
need for the message-boy to go elsewhere.</p>

<p>On calmly examining my notes I detected the
error. The sailor had read the word in the first rough
draft instead of the corrected copy. I started up
hurriedly and went to the counter through the
crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Duizendmaal vergiffenis!</span>&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Verschoon
my. Ik veroorzaak U veel moeite.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja mynheer</span>,&rdquo; he replied patiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Niet zwavel hier</span>,&rdquo; I said, pointing to my paper.
&lsquo;I have drawn my pencil through it,&rsquo; I wanted to
say, but of course couldn&rsquo;t. Then a happy thought
struck me. Say I have a line through it&mdash;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">streepje</span>
is the grammar word for a little line.</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">EEN STREEPJE DOOR.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer</span>,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">niet zwavel hier;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
zwavel niet. Ik heb een streepje door het.</span>&rdquo; Well,
would you believe me, that was the most successful
remark I had made as yet? I expected that
he would be irritated by my mistake and apology.
No such thing. He received my statement with
unbounded delight. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, ja</span>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">dat geloof
ik ook; dat geloof ik ook.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wel zeker</span>,&rdquo; I continued pleasantly, glad to see
him take it in such good part. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Een streepje door.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that they all turned to one another and
smiled and nodded to me quite merrily, as if I had
said something clever. It shows what a literary
people the Dutch are, that they are pleased beyond
measure when a foreigner in conversation refers to
any small technicality out of the grammar. Indeed
so encouraged was I by all this enthusiasm that I
boldly made use of my remaining words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mynheer! wilt u mij toestaan U te vragen.....
verkoopt gy snavels?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Snavels</span>,&rdquo; I repeated as he stared,&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">of snaveltjes</span>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>He gasped a moment, as if taken utterly by
surprise; then ran behind the counter into a little
dark room, where I could hear him make a succession
of curious muffled sounds. The noise subsided,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and he seemed to tell the story to somebody. A
white face peered out from behind the lace curtains&mdash;and
the chuckling was renewed. Now this was
all very puzzling&mdash;but it was quite clear that
&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">snavel</span>&rsquo; was not the usual term for &lsquo;pen&rsquo;.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">HOENDERHOK</span> WAS ALWAYS DOUBTFUL.</div>

<p>Here the little errand-boy entered with a package
which he thrust into my hand.</p>

<p>Sulphur!</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Heelemaal neen</span>,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>I was vainly endeavouring to get him to take
it back, when the shopman reappeared from his
dark den as grave as a judge, and I turned to him.</p>

<p>There was one word left. It might be right,
though I had doubted it from the first; but I
would try. It was a long word, too, and from the
root of the first part, it promised to have something
to do with fowls. Thus I conjectured that its
meaning might be &lsquo;quill pen&rsquo;; but my confidence
in the dictionary was by this time much shaken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wilt gij my toestaan</span>&rdquo;, I said, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">U te vragen?</span>&rdquo;
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, mijnheer!</span>&rdquo; he replied expectantly.</p>

<p>Then I got a little confused, and no wonder.
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Durf ik zoo beleefd te kunnen zijn!... om mij
mede te deelen en ... mij te verwittigen?</span>&rdquo; I lost
myself again. It&rsquo;s easy to begin a Dutch conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
but hard to get out of it with honour. Like a drowning
man clutching at a straw I grasped at something:
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Verkoopt jullie hoenderhokken ... of hoenderhokkjes?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE UMBRELLA TO THE RESCUE.</div>

<p>He said nothing&mdash;did not even look at me&mdash;but
moved his hands helplessly, as if subduing some
strong emotion. I did not press this word on him,
as I scarcely ever use quill pens; and it was as
likely as not that the dictionary had failed me again.</p>

<p>I set him at his ease by a courteous phrase
or two. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het geeft niets&mdash;het hindert niet&mdash;het
komt er niet op aan.</span>&rdquo; Then refraining from
further speech, I pointed out some nibs with my
umbrella, and, having secured a box of excellent
J pens, made good my retreat under cover of a
friendly phrase or two: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer! het spijt mij
zeer; maar ik moet afscheid nemen. Vaarwel.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>It had been rather a strain, and I was glad to
get out again into the open air. On the way home
I could think it all over calmly, and at leisure I
deduced that most useful principle <em>never to use
more than one word out of the dictionary for
one word of English</em>.</p>

<small>LOCAL COLOUR.</small></h2>


<p>After these efforts I judged it wise to take a
day or two&rsquo;s rest from the actual practice of
Dutch conversation till my nerves had recovered
their tone, and until I had mastered more of the
grammar and the idiom. I was the more concerned
to do so as Enderby, to whom I had
related my purchase of the pens, told me that
my language on that occasion had been much
too stiff and formal. For the purpose then of
acquiring an everyday vocabulary I listened
attentively to the talk in the streets and tram-cars.
Most of it was unintelligible to me, but
I caught up some vigorous and happy phrases
here and there. These I soon learned to pronounce
in a kind of way, but it was difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
get at their exact meaning, for many popular
idioms did not appear in my dictionary at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">SCHEI UIT! SCHIET OP! TOE DAN!</div>

<p>There was a vocable that occasioned me some
perplexity&mdash;indeed a haze envelopes it still. It
sounded like <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Eris</i>, but had nothing to do with
the Goddess of Strife. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any
particular signification, and you can introduce it
anywhere to give a finish to your style. Some people
were fond of <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">evetjes</i>, a word of the same class,
on which none of my books shed the least light.
Though my authorities were likewise silent about
<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Toe! toe dan</i>, I perceived that this was the proper
expression for courteous appeal, and as such
I have always used it, with confidence and success.</p>

<p>Two curious imperative moods, which were popular
at the street corners, I did find in my grammar.
They belong to that provoking category of words
that, as you touch them carelessly, break up into
smaller verbs and prepositions. I used to compare
them mentally to those lizards that drop their tails
when you handle them roughly. Only instead of
tails these <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">werkwoorden</i> drop their <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">voorzetsels</i>, which
turn up again unexpectedly in distant parts of the
sentence. One of these &ldquo;lizards&rdquo; was <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">schei uit</i>, which
means indifferently, &lsquo;stop talking now&rsquo;, &lsquo;analyse it&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and &lsquo;go away&rsquo;. It was pleasant to hear so scientific
a term as <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">schei er uit</span> or <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">schiet nouw op</span> (shoot up
now, aim high) used so often. I soon became quite
dexterous in employing them myself. On the whole
I got little help from my dictionary in tracing out
the idioms of everyday live. Two interrogative particles,
for example, without which the lower classes,
when excited, could hardly ask a question, were
quite ignored both by Boyton and the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Woordenboek</span>.
The were <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Zaliku</i> and <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Woujeme</i>. I was left to conjecture
the force of these particles&mdash;that they
were forcible I could see&mdash;might remotely resemble
that of the familiar <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">num</span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nonne</span> of Latin.</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">GUNST! HEUS! MIS!</div>

<p>Occasionally animated interlocutors became suddenly
oracular: their flow of language stopped and
they uttered some one solitary syllable such
as <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Gunst!</i> or <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">heus!</i> or <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">mis!</i> or <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">raak!</i> These single
shots were often most effective, but I never could
imitate them successfully. <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ach!</i> was safe mostly
for &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo;; <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Och!</i> for &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care&rdquo;; and I
discovered a treasure in <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">H√©!</i> That is a contraction
for &ldquo;Do you really mean it?&rdquo; On the other hand
<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">H√®!</i> I found was &ldquo;Shocking!&rdquo; &ldquo;How very dreadful!&rdquo;
When I used these little words I seemed never
quite to hit the bull&rsquo;s eye, however. Invariably I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
said either more or less than I intended. But I made
very good play with pretty triplets like <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">&rsquo;t zal wel</i>,
and <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">schei er uit</i>, and with expressions of approval:
<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">da&rsquo;s leuk</i>, <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">aardig hoor</i>, <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">och kom</i>. It gives a vivid
local colour to your conversation if you drop in now
and again a homely fresh idiom caught from the
lips of the people. That prevents one&rsquo;s vocabulary
becoming too bookish. You can give quite a realistic
flavour to your remarks by interjecting occasionally
<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">waarempeltjes</i> or <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wel van mijn leven!</i> Among the
encouraging ejaculations of every day I soon concluded
that none was more likely to prove useful
than &ldquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Zanik nou niet</i>&rdquo;, a popular favourite which
one may render roughly by &ldquo;Pray, don&rsquo;t mention
it&rdquo;, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble about it&rdquo;. This idiom has been
simply invaluable.</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ZANIK NOU NIET.</div>

<p>Anomalies of pronunciation were not numerous,
but they existed. <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nouw</i>, a common word, must
be spelt <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">nu</i>; and the advice <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">duwen</i>, which was
printed up on the inner door of the Post-Office,
was pronounced <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">douwe</i>. Most enigmatical perhaps
was the contrast between the barber&rsquo;s notice
on the window of his establishment, and what
he said to you when you entered. Outside it
was <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">haarsnijden</i> and never anything else. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
is the printed form; inside, however, you must
pronounce it <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">haarknippen</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WORD FOR LIGHTNING.</div>

<p>Still these are trifles compared with the real
puzzles. I witnessed a street dispute one evening.
It was about herring, I think, but I really couldn&rsquo;t
follow the one thousandth part of the vigorous
debate. Picturesque idioms were bandied to and
fro; happily no harm was done. One could not
help noticing that the Grammar-book was right.
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jij</span> and <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">jou</span> were freely employed, and the disputants
did not once address each other as <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">U</span> or
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">UEdele</span>. On that occasion there was another
epithet or pronoun or interjection, which none
of my previous studies had at all prepared me
for. Turning it up in the dictionary as well as
I could, I learnt that it might be translated by
&lsquo;lightning&rsquo;, and that it was an ordinary noun. Next
day I enquired of Enderby if the word for lightning
could ever be employed as an interrogative
particle or a pronoun. He was horrified and said
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be vulgar&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to be,
but what about that personal pronoun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Stop; it&rsquo;s not a pronoun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well whatever it is,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;noun or pronoun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
if you had heard it used as I did, you
would admit that it was very <em>personal</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">IS TO BE ESCHEWED.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frivolous,&rdquo; he retorted solemnly, &ldquo;and
let me give you a piece of advice. As long as you
are in Holland never let anyone hear you utter that
word. Say <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">onweer</i> or <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">weerlicht</i>. The other word is
not decent, it is almost wicked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There now; don&rsquo;t be surly&rdquo;, I reasoned, &ldquo;the
thing is in the dictionary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind. That&rsquo;s for science or for poetry.
Then it&rsquo;s all right. But <em>you</em> had better have nothing
to do with it. Try and forget it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did try. But I didn&rsquo;t succeed.</p>

<p>For the more trouble you take to forget a thing,
the better you remember it. At least that&rsquo;s my
experience, and if I strain every nerve to get a
word out of my head, it simply never goes! So if
there be a Dutch noun that I recall accurately and
without effort, it is just the scientific and poetical
term for &lsquo;lightning&rsquo;.</p>

<small>A WASH-LIST IN DUTCH.</small></h2>


<p>It was a day or two after the purchase of the
pens and I was beginning to feel my zeal for Dutch
returning, when the landlady entered the sitting-room
and fired my enthusiasm. She had a collar and a
pocket-handkerchief in her hand; she waved them
in the air and said &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Voor de waschvrouw</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I caught the idea at once, banished the landlady,
and sat down to make out a wash-list with
the help of the dictionary and by the light of
nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">HOE</span> TO SELECT YOUR WORD.</div>

<p>In bold characters I headed my document &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Lijst
voor de Waschvrouw</span>&rsquo;; and turned up the word
&lsquo;collar&rsquo;. The usual thing, of course, met my gaze&mdash;a
bewildering supply of equivalents&mdash;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">boordje,
rollade, kraag, halsband, halssieraad</span>. Now for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
crucial question&mdash;on what principle am I to make
my selection? For I was quite determined to stick
by the principle I had learnt in the pen-shop, and
use only one Dutch word for one word in English. But
which one? The dictionary had a second part to it,
Dutch into English. So I felt sure in my innocence
that I could hunt down anything and get its exact
signification.</p>

<p>I tried &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">boordje</span>&rsquo;.</p>

<p>It was a bad omen that &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">boordje</span>&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t figure
in the Dutch-English part at all. Naturally a man
reasons that if <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">boordje</span> really means a common
thing like collar&mdash;an article of attire in daily
use&mdash;it would surely be given a place in a Dutch-English
lexicon. It wasn&rsquo;t there; and to confirm
me in my determination to reject &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">boordje</span>&rsquo;, my eye
caught &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">boord</span>&rsquo;. &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Boord</span>&rsquo; was of fairly catholic application;
for it included things as dissimilar as
border, rim, shelf, seam, bank and hem. To make
a diminutive of this,&mdash;&lsquo;little border&rsquo;, &lsquo;little rim&rsquo;,
&lsquo;little bank&rsquo;,&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t bring one measurably
nearer &lsquo;collar&rsquo;. <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Boordje</em> therefore was rejected absolutely.
So far good.</p>

<p><em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Rollade</em> was more promising. It suggested somehow
a turn-down collar, and sounded courtly. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
there was against it the strong objection that it
didn&rsquo;t appear in the Dutch-English lexicon. <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Rollade</em>
therefore was set aside provisionally.</p>

<p><i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Kraag</i> again offered well, but on inspection
proved far too vague, for it included the ideas of
cape, neck, nape and hood. That wouldn&rsquo;t do. It
was far too uncertain. Therefore &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Kraag</span>&rsquo; was marked
as &lsquo;doubtful.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">ETYMOLOGY AN UNSAFE GUIDE.</div>

<p>Diligence however is its own reward, and I found
a prize in the next word. <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Halsband</em> answered every
reasonable expectation. It stood every test I could
apply to it.</p>

<p>The Dutch-English lexicon said it was &lsquo;collar&rsquo;,
and nothing more.</p>

<p>Etymology confirmed the dictionary: <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">hals</i>, the
neck; <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">band</i>, a band&mdash;a band for the neck&mdash;what
could be clearer? If that wasn&rsquo;t collar, nothing was.</p>

<p>So I wrote down with much confidence, as my
first item, <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">6 halsbanden</em>. I felt that this was an
excellent beginning and that Dutch was not such a
difficult language after all. <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Gunst!</i> I said to myself;
for I felt so elated at my success, that in a way I
was almost thinking in Dutch. <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Gunst, uitstekend!</span> now
for the next article.</p>

<p>That was <em>cuff</em>. Cuff said the dictionary was<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl"> slag,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
manchet, oorveeg</span> and <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">handboei</span>. Which would I
take? I examined <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">slag</i>, and learnt it was the proper
term for battle, fight, or opportunity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COMMON-SENSE MISLEADING.</div>

<p>This gave me much food for thought. I turned
the matter over in every possible way, yet to no
purpose. It was impossible to detect any necessary
connection between a &lsquo;battle&rsquo; or an &lsquo;opportunity&rsquo;,
and &lsquo;a pair of cuffs&rsquo;; so I dropped &lsquo;slag&rsquo; without regret.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Oorveeg</em>&rsquo; at first looked more attractive.</p>

<p>Its derivation, however, showed that it was
something that &lsquo;skimmed along&rsquo; the ear, or &lsquo;touched
it lightly&rsquo;!</p>

<p>Now it was conceivable that the sleeves or cuffs
of ancient times had proved inconvenient; but that
they had ever been so large as to flap about one&rsquo;s
ears, I positively refused to believe.</p>

<p>It was quite a comfort to discover, as I did
somewhat by accident, that &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">oorveeg</span>&rsquo; meant a &lsquo;box
on the ear.&rsquo; Thus I could reject it without scruple&mdash;which
I did.</p>

<p><em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Manchet</em> was so obviously French that I never
looked at it twice. My grammar was most stringent
in banishing all foreign words. Especially avoid French
terms, it insisted. That was an easy rule. <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Geen
Fransch woordje bij!</span> So I avoided <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">manchet</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ZIE-BENEDEN.</div>

<p>I had now only one word left, which of course
must be right. <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Handboei</span>, moreover, defined its own
functions with welcome precision. It obviously meant
something to <em>fit</em> closely round the <em>hand</em>; and with
a sense of having achieved an intellectual victory,
I set down on my list below the &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">halsbanden</span>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">4 paar handboeien</i>&rsquo;.</p>

<p>After this discipline in the art of &lsquo;rejections and
exclusions&rsquo; it seemed child&rsquo;s play to fix on the proper
rendering for <em>sock</em>.</p>

<p><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Sok&mdash;blyspel&mdash;vilten binnenzool&mdash;ploegschaar</span>,&mdash;that
was what the front part of the
dictionary gave me to work upon. &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Blyspel</span>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ploegschaar</span>&rsquo; I dropped overboard without qualm,
for I found they meant &lsquo;comedy&rsquo; and &lsquo;ploughshare&rsquo;;
and when it came to choosing between <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">sok</span> and
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">vilten binnenzool</span>, I gave the first the preference,
as my book shed no light whatever on <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">vilten binnenzool</span>.</p>

<p>I regretted this rather, as there was a fine air
of dignity about the latter.</p>

<p>But I put down &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">4 paar sokken</span>,&rsquo; with a note of
interrogation, and added &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">vilten binnenzolen</span>&rsquo; in
brackets&mdash;to make all clear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KERCHIEF OF QUEEN ELIZABETH.</div>

<p>There were seven &lsquo;handkerchiefs&rsquo; to be translated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
into Dutch; and for &lsquo;handkerchief&rsquo; the little fat
Dictionary became more than usually oracular.</p>

<p>Opposite the English word it had two Dutch
words without a comma between, so that I felt
morally certain it was a case of <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">vilten binnenzool</span>
again&mdash;a sort of euphonious compound which you
must take in its entirety or not at all.</p>

<p>This compound word was &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Zie beneden</span>&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I soon detected that the primitive meaning of
this curious name was &lsquo;look below&rsquo;. At first indeed
it struck me that it might refer to a footnote; but
there was no footnote in the Dictionary, good or
bad, from cover to cover, except B* on page 91,
so I soon abandoned this idea as fanciful.</p>

<p>It was certainly hard to trace any connection
between the advice (imperative mood, if you please)
&lsquo;see below!&rsquo; and what we usually understand by a
&lsquo;handkerchief&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The mystery seemed to clear a little when I remembered
that a &lsquo;handkerchief&rsquo; was a &lsquo;kerchief&rsquo;
for the hand; and that in the Tudor age &lsquo;kerchiefs&rsquo;
used to be worn round the neck. In fine old historical
portraits that I had seen of Queen Elizabeth
and Queen Mary, their Majesties were always represented
with elaborate cambric things about their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
shoulders. It was quite a feature of the period.
Thus &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">zie beneden</span>&rsquo; was no doubt the original word
corresponding to &lsquo;kerchief&rsquo;; and it would take its
name from the fact that when the wearer in ancient
times glanced down, he could easily see it on his
chest. He would call it a &lsquo;look below&rsquo; quite naturally.
Then the name would remain unaltered,
while the article would become first a kerchief for
the hand, then finally a pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A WORK OF ART.</div>

<p>As there were plenty of analogies in English for
that sort of word formation, I became quite sure
of my ground, and at the end of my list wrote
with the pride of a philologist, &lsquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">7 ziebenedens</i>&rsquo;.</p>

<p>A few other words I got with comparative ease,
and jotted down in their places.</p>

<p>The more I looked at my finished document,
the better I liked it.</p>

<p>This is how it ran:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">VOOR EEN HOND.</div>

<p>I was quite unprepared for the effect which
my manuscript had on the landlady. When she
came up presently for the wash-list, I said to her
carelessly, as if I was in the habit of writing
Dutch every day, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Voor de waschvrouw,&mdash;klaar</span>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>She took the document in her hand and glanced at
it; then suddenly sat down in my best arm-chair!</p>

<p>Now you must know that she is very respectful,
always stands deferentially in my presence, and
never dreams of taking liberties. Her conduct now
was unaccountable. There she sat in the chair, rocking
to and fro, her face hidden with both hands. Her
agitation increased till finally she gave a kind of snort,
for which she immediately apologised: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Neem me
niet kwalijk, mijnheer! neem me niet kwalijk!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having regained a momentary composure, she
dried her eyes with the corner of her apron and
allowed her gaze to wander round the room. It
fell upon my paper, and off she went again in a
sort of suppressed shriek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">O mijnheer! mijnheer!</span>&rdquo; she stammered convulsively.
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het is&mdash;voor&mdash;voor een hond!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">MOET MIJNHEER NAAR DE GEVANGENIS?</div>

<p>She ended with a hysterical sob as if she feared
her emotions would choke her utterance.</p>

<p>All this naturally raised my suspicions as to the
purity of my Dutch, though it seemed incredible
that there could be much amiss with it. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Voor een
hond</span>&rdquo; sounded like an expression of contempt,
just as we dub ill-composed Latin, &lsquo;Dog-Latin&rsquo;, or
pronounce poor food to be &lsquo;not fit for a dog.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She surely couldn&rsquo;t imply that my Dutch would
make a dog laugh?</p>

<p>It was clear now that she was highly amused
at something I had written. At this I was just
a little indignant, having spent all the morning
hunting up equivalents in the dictionary and debating
with myself about them.</p>

<p>To discourage her levity I answered quite coldly:
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wat is voor een hond? ik zie geen hond. Waar
is hij?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">O mijnheer</span>&rdquo;, was the spasmotic reply, delivered
in jerks, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">halsband,&mdash;hals&mdash;band&mdash;is altijd
voor&mdash;voor een hond! Ik lach me dood!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could not argue the point with her or convince
her by reasoning that my choice must be
correct.</p>

<p>So I just said &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">H√©!</span>&rdquo; and waited for her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
recover. Presently she dried her eyes again, rose
from the arm-chair, and tried to get away; but
once more her eye fell on the fatal manuscript&mdash;this
time on<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl"> Handboeien</span>&mdash;and again she dropped
back with a smothered yell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">QUEEN ELIZABETH IS UNKNOWN.</div>

<p>Then she apologized, then cried, then laughed,
then finally gathered breath to say, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Voor een
gevangene! Moet mijnheer naar de gevangenis?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik weet het niet</span>,&rdquo; I protested in perplexity;
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ik weet er niets van. Wat is gevangenis?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose, and silently picking up my little dictionary,
with an unsteady hand turned over to &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">gevangenis</span>.&rsquo;
She pointed to the English and I read &lsquo;prison&rsquo;.
Thus the &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">handboeien</span>&rsquo; were &lsquo;handcuffs&rsquo;!</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t say she was mistaken. So I merely
drew my pen through this item and said &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">H√®!</span>&rdquo;
letting the matter rest.</p>

<p>Now she laughed at everything, at <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">nachtgewaden</span>,
at <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">voorwerpen</span>, at my message to the washerwoman,
even at <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">sokken</span>, though since I have never
been able to discover why, except that it was the
only proper word on the list.</p>

<p>But nothing could make her understand what I
meant by <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Zie-benedens</span>.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t explain to her all about Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Elizabeth and Queen Mary and the parallel historical
development of cognate languages; I hadn&rsquo;t
Dutch enough for it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DON&rsquo;T REASON.</div>

<p>Pulling a handkerchief out of my pocket, and
showing it to her, I said, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Dit&mdash;dit is een zie
beneden!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at that she only laughed the more.</p>

<p>Then she chuckled and tittered and coughed
and said &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Oh! Oh!</span>&rdquo; and held her sides and stumbled
all the way down those steep stairs to the
imminent danger of her life. Half way down she
had stopped for breath; distinctly I could hear her
panting and muttering: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Oh mens! mens! Ik kan
nie meer. Ik stik!</span>&rdquo; For the rest of the day bursts
of jovial laughter kept rising from the kitchen, and
an air of hilarity hung about the lower storey for a
whole week.</p>

<p>Sir, said O&rsquo; Neill, that is the deplorable result
of bringing reason to bear on the material the
dictionary gives. For here is another general
principle I have discovered about languages: <em>The
more arguments you find in favour of any given
word the more certain it is that that word is
totally wrong.</em></p>

<small>SOME MISUNDERSTANDINGS.</small></h2>


<p>Next evening Jack O&rsquo;Neill resumed his narrative
to myself alone, on the understanding that our
friends would drop in if they could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where was I?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ah, yes, I had just
told you about the wash-list.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; I learnt many things in the next few
days, said he,&mdash;especially grammar. Rules and
exceptions I committed to memory and could rattle
you off <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">werkwoorden</span> and <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">voortzetsels</span>, <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">bijvoegelijke
naamwoorden, verleden deelwoorden</span> and<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl"> onbepaalde
wijzen</span> with vigour and promptitude.</p>

<p>In walking about the town and neighbourhood,
too, I caught up more and more of those
native idioms that give colour and fragrance
to one&rsquo;s speech. Of course I was at a loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
now and again to explain what I heard and saw.</p>

<p>The notice boards, for example, of some inn
such as &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">De Nieuwe Aanleg</span>&rdquo; remained somewhat
mysterious; and on enquiry a satisfactory translation
was never forthcoming. &ldquo;The New Genius&rdquo; was
very wide of the mark, evidently. &ldquo;The New
Tendency&rdquo; was equally obscure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHAT&rsquo;S PUT IN DUTCH?</div>

<p>Two common English verbs I found very difficult
to render exactly. These were &lsquo;drive&rsquo; and &lsquo;put&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Put&rsquo; you have to use so often that it is certainly
provoking to hunt for a new verb almost every time
you have a fresh order to give. &lsquo;Put it down&rsquo;, &lsquo;put
it in the cupboard,&rsquo; &lsquo;put it in the hall&rsquo;&mdash;well,
I managed these somehow. But when it came to
having letters posted, I was a long time at sea.</p>

<p>I wrote a good deal; and &lsquo;put that letter in the
box&rsquo; was a common order I had to give. Now &lsquo;box&rsquo;
was easy enough, for the receptacle in the street
was duly called &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Brievenbus</span>&rsquo;. But when I said,
&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Plaats dien brief in de brievenbus</span>,&rsquo; the maidservant
stared at me as if I was hardly human.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Zet</span>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">werp</span>&rsquo; were not much clearer, apparently.
&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Gooi</span>&rsquo;, I must admit, always made her perform
the task with alacrity, but with an air that
plainly said the matter was not very serious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>By a happy accident I became aware that all
you need say for &lsquo;put&rsquo; is &lsquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">doe</i>&rsquo;; but alas! it will
only help you for a few of the simplest &lsquo;puts&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Two functionaries called about orphans one day,
and I said &ldquo;Put me down for five guilders&rdquo;. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Doe
mij beneden voor vijf gulden</span>&rdquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t idiomatic,
but they caught the idea when they saw the coins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT.</div>

<p>Of course the long and the short <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">a</em> are notorious,
and they perplexed me nearly every time I worked
with them. You can&rsquo;t be always sure that you have
hit the right one.</p>

<p>An important letter had to go off one evening, and
I impressed on the domestic that she must be careful.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Voorzichtig hoor!&mdash;voorzichtig!</span>&rsquo; I repeated,
&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">want dit is een gewichtige zak</span>&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I might have spared myself the trouble, for she
tossed it in one hand and said, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Een zak, mijnheer,
ha!</span>&rdquo; and departed with a gaiety of manner that
augured ill for the safety of my missive. All the while I
imagined I had said <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">zaak</em>,&mdash;but my <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">a</em> was too short.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BEAUTIFUL MAN.</div>

<p>One night when the landlady&rsquo;s son&mdash;a promising
youth of thirteen&mdash;brought up the supper, he
appeared playful and excited. He urged me, as I
understood it, to come downstairs and admire a man
that was in the street. Surely it must be a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
specimen of manly grace that could elicit this interest!
Yes, the man there was &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">erg mooi</span>&rsquo;, he assured me.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">U moet es eve kome kijke, mijnheer.</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>The request was odd, and I refused at first. As
he persisted, however, I accompanied him downstairs,
wondering whether there was an acrobat performing
in the market-place or if a statue had been erected
whilst I was at dinner.</p>

<p>When we came outside, there was nothing remarkable
to be seen in the street. My guide, however,
didn&rsquo;t mind that, but pointing triumphantly to the
sky where the full moon was shining, he exclaimed
with delight: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Daar, mijnheer, kijk nou is, nietwaar?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>It looked like boyish chaff, getting the foreigner
to leave his room to gaze at the &lsquo;man in the moon&rsquo;,
and I was dumb with indignation at his audacity.
Gradually, however, the facts of the case emerged.
The youth was only considerately anxious that I should
not miss seeing the big Dutch moon itself, which was
indeed that evening particularly fine. It was a &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">mooi
maan</span>&rsquo; not &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">man</span>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Yes; the long and the short <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">a</em> are not to be trifled
with, and you&rsquo;ll get into no end of trouble if you
ever mix them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br /><br />

<small>OUT FOR A WALK.</small></h2>


<p>Starting one morning for a long ramble in the
country I took the first stage by tram. It was
very early, and as there were no other passengers,
the conductor was disposed to be communicative.
He was absolutely eager to talk, and he came up
to me at once.</p>

<p>Now I have noticed that at one time it is much
easier to express oneself in a foreign language
than at another.</p>

<p>Sometimes the grammar you have mastered becomes
positively oppressive, and your tongue refuses to
lend itself to the task.</p>

<p>I cannot tell whether it may be due to barometric
pressure or to some electrical condition, but
on certain days I cannot&mdash;to put it mildly&mdash;come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
up to my normal standard, either of perspicuity
or ease.</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">NAAR HET EINDE.</div>

<p>This was one of my bad days, and I was little
inclined to respond to the conductor&rsquo;s advances.
Fate was against me, however, for I didn&rsquo;t know
the name of the place I was bound for. Enderby
had several times taken me to a pretty village
some few miles from the Hague. It was the terminus
of the tram-line, and I purposed to tram
there first and then to start out on my country
walk.</p>

<p>I had never troubled much about the geography
of the district, and consequently was quite in the
dark now as to what the village was called.
This was awkward, for the talkative conductor was
already at hand trying to open conversation.</p>

<p>He made a first essay by producing his bunch of
tickets and asking me, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hoe ver, mijnheer?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I waved my hand and said, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Den geheelen weg.</span>&rdquo;
Seeing he was not satisfied with this, I amplified
the remark by adding &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Naar het einde.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he was still slightly bewildered, I glanced
up to the tram-car itself to ascertain, if possible,
its destination. The designation of the village
would surely be printed somewhere on the vehicle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Happily I could just make out at the end of a long
series of hard words the name &lsquo;Simplex&rsquo;. Pointing to this
with a careless flourish of my stick I said &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja;
ik ga even naar Simplex.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">A ONE-SIDED CONVERSATION.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Net, mijnheer</span>,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ha! ha!, overal
reclame!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before he had recovered from my unconscious
wit, I perceived the error into which I had fallen.
Simplex was merely a cycle-advertisement.</p>

<p>Then I laughed as heartily as he, saying &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Gunst
ja; overal</span>&rdquo;&mdash;which emboldened him to be still more
familiar.</p>

<p>He fancied that I was a perfect master of Dutch,
and could even joke in it. He talked most volubly;
and,&mdash;my reputation as a linguist being now at
stake,&mdash;whenever he made a slight pause I was
obliged to say something to show I understood.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand. But I started him off always
when he was inclined to stop, and I kept him
going by a careful use of &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ja</span>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">neen</span>&rsquo;. If he
appeared to expect agreement, I threw in a hearty
&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">natuurlijk</span>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ja zeker</span>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">wel van mijn leven</span>.&rsquo; At
other points, and for variety&rsquo;s sake, I interjected
indignant negatives: &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wel nee!</span>&rsquo; &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">schei er uit!</span>&rsquo; &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hoe
heb ik het met je?</span>&rsquo;&mdash;and now and then even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">och kom!</span>&rsquo; with the peculiar shake of the head
that accompanies this phrase.</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">KOLOSSAAL MOOI.</div>

<p>The plan was brilliantly successful. True, he
stopped sometimes and took a long queer look at me;
but he was one of those garrulous people that require
little encouragement, and the flood of his reminiscences
always poured forth again as freely as ever.</p>

<p>We got along famously together&mdash;though I
didn&rsquo;t know one word he said&mdash;till we came
opposite a tall church. Nodding patronisingly towards
this building he said, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Pracht van een Kerk</span>&rdquo;, adding
something about a &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">hooge toren</span>&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Here I felt on solid ground,&mdash;I understood
him thoroughly. My natural wish to take an intelligent
part in the conversation would be gratified if only
I could say something about that edifice; and, one
of the fresh idioms that I had recently acquired
occurring to me, I promptly gave it to him by way
of reply: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, prachtig; het is kolossaal mooi.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>This choice idiom I had got just the day before
from a policeman. We had been standing in front of
a florist&rsquo;s window&mdash;the policeman and I&mdash;admiring
the tiny vases of lilies of the valley that were
displayed there, when I heard him murmur half to
himself and half to me &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">kolossaal mooi!</span>&rdquo; The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
combination so captivated my fancy that I added
it without delay to my working stock.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LIGHTNING CONDUCTOR.</div>

<p>The tram-conductor emphatically agreed with my
criticism. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Kolossaal!</span>&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged I attempted to contribute something
further to the conversation, and catching sight
of a lofty lightning-conductor, on the church-steeple,
I tried to draw his attention to it by an easy
grammatical remark.</p>

<p>The word &lsquo;lightning-conductor&rsquo; did not seem to
present difficulties.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lightning&rsquo; of course I remembered, though I
ought to have forgotten it long ago. No doubt it
was to be approached with caution; but as this
was a matter of pure science I felt tolerably safe.
As for &lsquo;conductor&rsquo;, there could be little doubt as
as to the way to render that, for &lsquo;conducteur&rsquo; was
stamped on the tram-man&rsquo;s buttons, and had been
staring me in the face for the last half-hour. Those
buttons were as good as a dictionary.</p>

<p>Putting together then the component parts of
&lsquo;lightning-conductor,&rsquo; I hazarded a bold guess, and
waving my hand towards the steeple I said cordially,
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, de toren is mooi&mdash;kolossaal mooi. Gunst; ja.&mdash;Zoo
is ook die bliksem-conducteur! Vind U niet?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">TAKE CARE OF YOUR WORDS.</div>

<p>Well, he stopped as if I had struck him; his face
got fiery red, and he walked away without a word!</p>

<p>What had I done? There was no denying something
had gone wrong. Evidently the man was
choking with rage, and he didn&rsquo;t as much as glance
at me for the rest of the journey.</p>

<p>That same afternoon I reported the affair to
Enderby, who grew quite gruff and crusty before
I had finished the narration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I warn you&rdquo;, he grumbled, &ldquo;against
those horrid expressions that you seem so fond of?
You must really take care, O&rsquo;Neill,&mdash;or I won&rsquo;t
speak to you as long as you stay in Holland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was useless to assure him that I had referred
to the &lsquo;lightning-conductor&rsquo; merely in its permissible
and scientific sense. He would listen to no
explanations. &ldquo;You simply can&rsquo;t imagine how shocking
all that talk of yours sounds, or you wouldn&rsquo;t
attempt to justify your vulgarity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begging your lordship&rsquo;s pardon&rdquo;, I retorted
ironically, &ldquo;for all my unseemly conduct, may I
enquire humbly what the dignified term is? <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Onweersconducteur</em>,
perhaps? Or <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">weerlichtsconducteur</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; he almost shouted. &ldquo;The thing&rsquo;s quite
easy&mdash;&lsquo;<em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">bliksemafleider</em>&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A CHARMING WALK.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; I could not help retorting, &ldquo;you see after
all you are in the wrong. You warned me against
<em>lightning</em>&mdash;quite needlessly, you now admit&mdash;but
you never said a syllable about that really
dangerous word <em>conductor</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But to return to my trip that lovely morning.
The tram duly reached &lsquo;Simplex&rsquo;, and the conductor
was unfeignedly relieved to see me alight.</p>

<p>It was perfect weather, and my annoyances were
soon forgotten. There was such a shimmer and haze
and play of light over the wide landscape as I
have seen only in Holland.</p>

<p>I was delighted. Such a scene is an inspiration.
It makes one wish to be a painter or a poet or
something. Subtle and delicate shades varied the
long stretches of green meadow; clumps of trees,
church towers, tiny red-roofed villages dotted the
landscape; while here and there as far as the eye
could reach, wide canals&mdash;the very pictures of
tranquillity&mdash;reflected the great white clouds sailing
overhead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid, splendid!&rdquo; I exclaimed to myself. And
charming indeed did my ramble prove to be.</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">NAAST DE PALING.</div>

<p>But the day was hot, and I was glad at last about
eleven o&rsquo;clock to come to a good-sized tea-garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
over the entrance to which stood in conspicuous letters,
&ldquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Uitspanning</i>.&rdquo; Here was cool shade under broad
trees; and here were innumerable little tables at
which a number of people were seated, laughing and
chattering and lunching pleasantly, while little children,
some of them not more than three years old, kept
running about and playing games. And all these
tiny tots, too, were talking Dutch, happily and
unconcerned, tossing about in childish glee and with
incredible ease, <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">onbepaalde wijzen, verleden deelwoorden</span>
and <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">voorzetsels</span>, not to speak of <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">het</span> and <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">hen</span>
and <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">hun</span> and <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">je</span>.</p>

<p>On entering this popular resort and looking round
I was addressed by a breathless waiter laden with
plates. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Waar wou mynheer zitten?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shade was deepest under a noble elm, where
at this instant I spied an unoccupied seat close
to the wooden paling that skirted the enclosure. I
didn&rsquo;t know what &lsquo;paling&rsquo; was, but I chanced it,
as there was no time for the dictionary. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Naast de
paling</span>,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">als &rsquo;t U blieft</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The impatient waiter nearly dropped his tray, but
recovering himself he vanished, and I took the seat
myself. Another kellner appeared,&mdash;a slow grave
man in whose district was situated the attractive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
nook I had been fortunate enough to secure. The
day was broiling hot, as I told you, and I thought
I couldn&rsquo;t do better than begin with a little lemon-squash.</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">LIEMOEN-MOES.</div>

<p>I could have wished to study up my part a little;
but as the slow dignitary was already waiting, I
asked for a &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">limoen en een glas water</span>.&rdquo; Having
greeted my remark twice with &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">blief?</span>&rdquo; he drew
himself up and enquired if I wanted &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">liemonade</span>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Geen kwestie van</span>,&rdquo; I said, hauling out of my
pocket the little fat dictionary, that faithful companion
of my wanderings. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wacht even!</span>&rdquo; I hurriedly
turned up &ldquo;squash&rdquo;; for on the analogy of <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">meloen</span>
I assumed that &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">lemoen</span>&rsquo; was all right for lemon.
The verb squash was <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">moezen</em>; the noun <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">moes</em>. This
latter I chose, preferring the beverage ready-made,
if possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, kellner</span>&rdquo;&mdash;I said, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">nu weet ik het al.
Breng mij limoenmoes.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>He raised his eyebrows and said: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Bedoelt mijnheer
soms appelmoes?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apple squash? That seemed rather a good idea.
It sounded like cider or apple-lemonade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, best</span>,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">breng mij een glas appelmoes,
maar niet te sterk.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A MYSTERIOUS BEVERAGE.</div>

<p>When he was gone to draw some of this mysterious
beverage, who should turn up but Enderby? He
had been motoring; and was coming back from
Amsterdam when some pinion had given way, and
he had to stop at the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Uitspanning</span> for repairs. He
came up to me and sat down saying: &ldquo;Well, O&rsquo;Neill,
you&rsquo;re a long way from home; how did you get
here? What are you taking this hot weather?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly know. It&rsquo;s
apple-squash, or rather a sort of apple lemonade,&mdash;cider,
I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he with surprise, &ldquo;you talked English,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&mdash;not a word. I never speak English
now. It was all Dutch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I tell you, you <em>have</em> made progress with the
language! For here have I been in Holland for
fifteen years, and I never even heard of apple lemonade
yet. To tell you the truth, I should not know
how to ask for it. My boy, I congratulate you on
your linguistic enterprise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waiter reappeared just then, and Enderby
interposed, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mynheer heeft iets besteld, nietwaar?
Wat is dat voor een drankje? Geen limonade?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">MELOEN MET APPELMOES.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nee, menheer</span>&rdquo;, said the waiter in a complaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
tone, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">volstrekt niet, mynheer is wat vreemd, ziet
u; want</span>,&rdquo; and here his voice sank to a horrified
whisper, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">menheer eet meloen met appelmoes!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Enderby looked at me in speechless astonishment;
while the waiter murmured, perhaps as a further
suggestion of guilt on my part: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">We hebbe geen
paling!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matters had got so involved that I could not
explain anything to him; except to say that I had
started with the intention of cooling my thirst with
lemon squash.</p>

<p>He was inclined to be huffy once more. &ldquo;There
you are at it again! Look here now; do take some
care about what you say. I&rsquo;ll get that drink for
you this time; and, for any sake if you want &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">kwast</span>&rsquo;
again, don&rsquo;t say <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">appelmoes</span>. Indeed I strongly advise
you to stick to English, or you will get into worse
trouble yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Enderby went off in high dudgeon, and I took
a long ramble under the trees. It was not long
till I shook off the effects of my grammatical skirmishes
and began to enjoy the day to the full.</p>

<p>In point of fact I made several sketches, and
returning in a couple of hours had luncheon successfully.
That was comparatively easy. I had merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to say, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Koffie!&mdash;Kaas!</span>&rdquo;&mdash;and the meal was
ready.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DRIVE ME TO THE HAGUE.</div>

<p>Being by this time a trifle tired, I conceived
the idea of driving back to the Hague, for it
seemed too far to walk. In this design I was
encouraged by the presence of a considerable number
of vehicles with horses, standing about.</p>

<p>On examining my dictionary to get the Dutch idiom
for &lsquo;drive home&rsquo; I discovered three curious translations
for drive: &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">rijden</span>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">drijven</span>&rsquo; (used, I was informed, of
ice) and &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">jagen</span>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now seeing that &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">rijden</span>&rsquo;, meant &lsquo;to ride&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">jagen</span>,&rsquo; to &lsquo;hunt,&rsquo; and the other word was restricted
to icebergs, there really appeared to be a lack of the
precise term I needed.</p>

<p>Obliged thus to circumscribe my meaning, I rapped
on my green table and enquired, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Kellner, kan ik
een paard hebben?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waiter mumbled inarticulately, coughed apologetically,
and vanished like a shadow.</p>

<p>Presently he came back with a red-faced man
who seemed to be the proprietor of the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Uitspanning</span>.
What I wanted to say was, &ldquo;Have you a horse
disengaged to drive me to the Hague!&rdquo; but owing
to the defective character of the Dutch vocabulary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
this could not be said directly, and I was obliged
to go round the point.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A DREADFUL INTERVIEW.</div>

<p>I went round it thus: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mag ik beleefd vragen,
Mynheer, heeft U paarden beschikbaar om my te
dragen?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>This sounded diplomatic and neat, and was
certainly clear; but the apoplectic proprietor looked
askance.</p>

<p>He paused and endeavoured to transfix me with
his beady eyes and read my inmost consciousness.
This being impossible, he condescended to the gruff
question: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wou meneer een peerd koope?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Koopen?</span>&rdquo; I replied in astonishment, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">oh niet
koopen! Gunst! ashjeblieft niet.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Raie dan?</span>&rdquo; was his brusque reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Rijen, graag</span>,&rdquo; I agreed; &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">gaarne rijden; maar&mdash;ik
ben niet in staat het paard terug te zenden.
En ... en ik heb geen ruimte in mijn kamers voor
een paard.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wat dan?</span>&rdquo; said he rudely, with a kind of a
dull glare in his black eyes.</p>

<p>I was getting into deep water&mdash;there was
no use blinking the fact&mdash;and here was this
dreadful man growing more enraged and suspicious
every moment. Perhaps after all I could make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
something of those three doubtful dictionary words.
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Kan u niet</span>,&rdquo; I asked with some asperity, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">kan
oe niet, mijnheer, mij laten jagen naar den Haag?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE IRATE INN-KEEPER.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">O, h√©!</span>&rdquo; exclaimed my interlocutor with a
sudden access of interest and a kind of wrinkle
distantly resembling a smile. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Gaat mijnheer op
de jacht?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dear me, this is <em>too</em> bad, I thought, for I saw
people watching me with a curious air of disapproval,
and a good many more approaching. Really I regretted
I had not walked to the Hague.</p>

<p>But I was in for it now, and with all the sternness
I could command I explained sententiously, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik
wensch een paard!&mdash;Om mij te trekken&mdash;in
een rijtuig&mdash;naar den Haag, Ferdinand Bolstraat 66a.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>My horsey friend took a step nearer, his face
ominously darkening and the fierce eyes flashing
fire. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wat wou menheer eigenlijk? rijtuig huren?
of p√©rd koope!&mdash;of raie naar de stad?&mdash;of op
de jacht gaan?&mdash;of onzin praote?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was at my wit&rsquo;s end and deemed it wise to
retire as soon as possible from the conversation.
This I tried to do by means of that agreeable little
triplet that had hitherto proved so useful to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Och kom!</span>&rdquo; I said with a pleasant smile, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Geeft niets; het hindert niet; het komt er niet
op aan.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was unappeased, however. So by way of
friendly deprecation I added: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Laa maar! Schei er
uit.&mdash;H√®! zanik nou niet!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">A HAPPY ESCAPE.</div>

<p>This did not appreciably mend matters, I assure
you.&mdash;At every sentence I uttered his face grew
more purple&mdash;and I was intensely relieved when
at that moment one of the interested bye-standers
ran up hurriedly, whip in hand, and touching his
cap exclaimed: &ldquo;Drive you to the Hague, Sir?&rdquo;&mdash;It
was a cabdriver who spoke English!</p>

<p>Oh! I could have embraced that man!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I with effusion, &ldquo;Yes, at once, please!&mdash;as
quick as ever you can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I jumped up on his vehicle and, as the vendor
of <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">peerden</span> was still hovering unpleasantly near, I
ventured on one of those despised French verbs&mdash;it
was the only thing I could think of&mdash;to construct
an effective phrase for my exit.</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">VAARWEL.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mynheer Uitspanning!</span>&rdquo; I said waving him adieu,
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ik zal U niet verder derangeeren!&mdash;Vaarwel!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Good-bye at last! There was a faint cheer from
the score or two of spectators, but no response
from my late tormentor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>What a relief to get away from the intricacies
of that dreadful cross-examination!</p>

<p>I was flurried and worn, and did not quite recover
my equanimity or feel properly cooled down till I
was safely ensconced in my rooms in <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ferdinand
Bolstraat 66a</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a><br /><br />

<small>THE QUEST OF <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">MIJNHEER HIERNAAST</span>.</small></h2>


<p>On settling down in my rooms, I was reminded
of my social duties by seeing a card from young
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Van der Leeuwen</span> whom I had known at Trinity,
where he had studied a year.</p>

<p><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Van der Leeuwen</span> had called upon me more
than once and had invited me to his home. Up to
this time I had not seen him since I came to the Hague.</p>

<p>To-day he had scribbled on a visiting card &lsquo;Leaving
town soon for Arnhem.&rsquo; This showed me that
his friendly visit should be returned as soon as
possible: so early next afternoon I journeyed across
the city to see him.</p>

<p>I found however that the house was shut up. The
blinds were down and the whole place hermetically
sealed, so to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">MIJNHEER HIERNAAST.</div>

<p>On the door there was a singular notice, freshly
pasted, which at once arrested my attention and
which I copied into my notebook.</p>

<div lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">
<p>&ldquo;<i>Afwezig.</i></p>

<p><i>Brieven en boodschappen</i><br />
<span class="spl6"><i>te bezorgen bij</i></span><br />
<span class="spl8"><i>Mijnheer Hiernaast.</i>&rdquo;</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>Unhappily I had left my faithful companion, the
dictionary, at home. I was thus obliged to fall back
upon my stock of Dutch learning and guess what
I did not know.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Boodschappen</span>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">bezorgen</span>&rsquo; were new words
to me, but I seemed to gather the general sense
of the placard. If anybody wanted to see my friend
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van der Leeuwen</span>, or communicate with him, he
appeared to be invited to do so through the medium
of a gentleman called &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hiernaast</span>.&rdquo; The curious
thing was&mdash;no address was given to indicate
whereabouts Mr. <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hiernaast</span> lived.</p>

<p>Now this was very puzzling; for just that morning
I had been shown how particular you must be in
Holland about addresses. As I had not given word
to the authorities when I moved from the hotel to
my lodgings, I had been summoned to the &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Bevolkingsregisterbureau</span>,&rdquo;
and had to display my &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Geboorteacte</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A WELL-KNOWN MAN.</div>

<p>Innumerable details had been asked of me about
my name and initials and about my parents&rsquo; names
and initials,&mdash;some of which I could not satisfactorily
write out.</p>

<p>The functionaries at the office, too, had appeared
unnecessarily amused when I told them that I lodged in
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ferdinand Bolstraat</span> above a tinsmith&rsquo;s. On thinking it
over afterwards I admit that perhaps I had mixed the
word tinsmith with lightning conductor. I was naturally
anxious to avoid the latter scientific term as much as
possible; and my over anxiety probably defeated itself.</p>

<p>At all events I was told at the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Bureau</span> that it
was quite a serious offence&mdash;a sort of mild
treason&mdash;to move from my hotel to lodgings
without giving full information about the whole
matter to the civic dignitaries.</p>

<p>Now, as everybody was so particular about addresses,
I knew that <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van der Leeuwen</span> had more
respect for the laws of his country than to be
guilty of intentional carelessness; and I was sure
he would not try to defy the state by pasting
upon his door anything of the nature of mockery.
The notice <em>did</em> look like this: &ldquo;Out of town. If
you want to see me, go to Jericho;&rdquo; but my friend
would hardly have meant <em>that</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">THE OPENBARE MACHT.</div>

<p>I concluded therefore that Mr. <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hiernaast</span>&rsquo;s address
was known to everybody that read the notice, and
that Mr. <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hiernaast</span> was some prominent person like
the Burgomaster or the Town-clerk.</p>

<p>Perhaps he would be an official who kindly looked
after people&rsquo;s letters when they were out of town.
If so, a policeman would know all about him. There
was one passing at the moment, so I determined
to accost him and get what information I could.</p>

<p>Now Enderby and others had instructed me about
policemen. You must never say &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer</span>&rdquo; to a
policeman; he doesn&rsquo;t like it, for he thinks you
are making game of him. That&rsquo;s where I had made
the mistake before, in the Hague wood. I learnt
that his proper title is &lsquo;<em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">politieagent</em>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">agent</em>&rsquo;; the
newspapers call him &lsquo;<em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">openbare macht</em>&rsquo;. If he comes
from Amsterdam he will answer readily to <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">klabak</em>
or <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">smeeris</em>, though he may prefer a more dignified
title. He is known to the mob as a &lsquo;<em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">diender</em>&rsquo;, but
this is rather vulgar.</p>

<p>Naturally I wished to avoid the vulgar word
and use a respectful term; so stopping him I said,
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Openbare Macht, verschoon mij,&mdash;zult gij mij
toestaan om U beleefd te verzoeken,&mdash;waar
woont mijnheer Hiernaast?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">WOUJEME?</div>

<p>I guessed what he would do, and he did it. He
stared at me for about half a minute and then
said, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wah blief!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I responded, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">duizendmaal vergiffenis, dat
ik op....</span>&rdquo; And then I stopped <em>just in time</em>, for
it was on my tongue to finish the polite sentence
as I had repeated it so often from the conversation
book&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">dat ik op Uwen teen getrapt heb</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was well I didn&rsquo;t, for it didn&rsquo;t fit in at all accurately
with the situation. So I said, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Kijk nou is!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mag ik zoo vrij zijn, Klabak?</span>&rdquo; I murmured
courteously, showing him my copy of the placard
on the door, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer Hiernaast&mdash;ziet u&mdash;<em>waar</em>
woont <em>hij</em>?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, he couldn&rsquo;t have been more astonished if
had reached him a lighted bombshell.</p>

<p>Instead of meeting me with that ready sympathy
I had been reckoning upon, he was quite stiff. I
however persisted courteously with my question,
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, Openbare! wat zegt U, Smeeris? Woont mijnheer
Hiernaast in deze straat?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, he wasn&rsquo;t a bit polite; or if he was, he
must have been singularly deficient in charm of
manner, for he stared quite insolently at me and
grumbled, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Woujeme voor de gek houe?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">V√ì√ìR DEN HEKHOUDER.</div>

<p><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Woujeme, gekhoue?</span> Didn&rsquo;t I know some of those
words?</p>

<p>On considering this utterance of his I seemed
to recognise &ldquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">woujeme</i>&rdquo; as an old friend. Wasn&rsquo;t
that the introductory particle that was not in the
dictionary and which resembled the Latin &lsquo;nonne&rsquo;?
Then &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">gek</span>&rsquo; was remarkably like &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">hek</span>&rsquo;, which I knew
to be &lsquo;gate&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The landlady had always been talking about the
&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">hek</span>&rsquo; being open,&mdash;a state of affairs which she
strongly objected to, because dogs were in the habit
of strolling in and looking rudely at her through
the kitchen window.</p>

<p>Now I knew that it would be the easiest thing
in life for &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">gek</span>&rsquo; to be mistaken for &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">hek</span>&rsquo;.</p>

<p>London policemen often drop h&rsquo;s in one place
and put them in at another. Why shouldn&rsquo;t a
Hague policeman do something similar? You could
hardly expect a policeman to speak the language
with absolute accuracy.</p>

<p>So &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">gek houwe</span>&rsquo; would probably be a common
provincialism for &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">hek houden</span>&rsquo;. And I could easily
guess, on the analogy of &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">stalhouwer</span>&rsquo;, what <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">hekhouwer</span>&rsquo;
would mean. It would be, no doubt, a
&lsquo;man that made and sold gates&rsquo;. &lsquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">V√≥√≥r den gekhouwe(r)</i>&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
would then be, as nearly as possible, the
idiom for &lsquo;in front of the gate factory.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">MAAR&mdash;WAAR WOONT HIJ?</div>

<p>There was no gate factory in sight, so I continued
pleasantly making further enquiries of the policeman:
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Voor den gekhouwer?&mdash;ja zeker! asjeblieft!
Maar&mdash;zoudt gy zoo goed willen zijn&mdash;mij
mede te deelen,&mdash;waar <em>woont</em> die gekhouder?
Woont hij <em>in deze straat</em>? De gekkefabriek&mdash;waar
is dat?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I really pitied him, he looked so overwhelmed.
Then he did something wonderful that stayed all
further parley. He turned his head away, spread
out both white-gloved hands, raised his shoulders
slowly till they were well up over his ears, then slowly
let them down again to their normal and natural
position,&mdash;and all this without glancing at me.</p>

<p>It was an awe-inspiring spectacle,&mdash;apparently
some kind of military drill to repel idle questions.
I could only utter &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">&rsquo;t Geeft niets&mdash;&rsquo;t hindert niet&mdash;het
komt er niet op aan! Doe geen moeite,
Smeeris!</span>&rdquo; But he turned upon his heel and walked
away without even saying &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Vaarwel</span>&rsquo;!</p>

<p>Alas, I had failed again! I had displeased the
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Openbare Macht</span> and had not got a hint as to the
address of the official receiver of letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">BREATHE NOT HIS NAME.</div>

<p>All this was more than usually mysterious, so
I tried to extract some information from the landlady
that evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Waar woont Mijnheer Hiernaast?</span>&rdquo; I said to her
casually after dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hiern√°√°st, mijnheer</span>,&rdquo; she replied with strong
emphasis on the <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">naast</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t mind putting the accent on the final,&rdquo;
I murmured to myself. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Goed. Best.&mdash;Dan, waar
<em>woont</em> Mijnheer Hiern√°√°st?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hiern√°√°st</span>,&rdquo; she repeated, pointing through the
wall!</p>

<p>Had the good woman lost her senses? Or was
she trying to make fun of me? In either case I did
not quite care to prolong the conversation. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Lamaar</span>&rdquo;,
I interjected, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">het heeft niets te beduiden&mdash;schei
er uit,&mdash;zanik nou niet</span>&rdquo;. And I must say that
effectually stopped her.</p>

<p>The mystery was solved that same evening by
Enderby, who dropped in about half past ten.</p>

<p>We talked over a number of things and, as Enderby
was quite himself again after our little tiff at the
&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Uitspanning</span>&rsquo;, I just said, &ldquo;Do you happen to know
of the <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hiernaasts</em> in the Hague?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People called <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hiernaast</span>&rdquo;, I explained, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
seemed not to catch my meaning. &ldquo;They appear to
be rather well-known. The father I think is a Government
Official&mdash;a member of the Tweede-Kamer, I
imagine, or something of that sort. I&rsquo;m told he lives
opposite a large gate-factory. The queer thing about
the family is that, if you ask about them, everybody
gives you a silly answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EASY WHEN YOU KNOW IT.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Is he not in society, or what? Is his name like
the word for lightning? May I not refer to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo;Neill&rdquo;, exclaimed Enderby, rising suddenly off
his seat, &ldquo;you are surely not quite well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;were you out long in the
sun? That <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">appelmoes</em> must have gone to your head!
Tell me all that happened to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him the whole day&rsquo;s adventures; and
then I learnt that <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer Hiernaast</span> is&mdash;not
necessarily an Official of the Government or a
member of the Tweede Kamer; indeed that he
is no particular person at all; but&mdash;<em>just the
gentleman who lives next door to you, wherever
you happen to be</em>.</p>

<p>Well; that&rsquo;s easy enough, when you know it.
But when you don&rsquo;t, what are you to do?</p>

<small>THE PARCEL POST.</small></h2>


<p>You will remember that the day I was at Simplex
I took some sketches. Well, I bundled these up
along with some really exquisite water-colours
that I purchased at an art-shop, and I sent them
to Ireland.</p>

<p>Yes, I bought these pictures without pain. The
vendor of these objects of art spoke perfect
English; it was a delight to hear him. So
pleased was I with my purchases, that I hastened
home, there and then, and adding my own artistic
treasures, made a little square package of it all for
my aunt Rebecca in Connemara, Killery Bay,&mdash;a
place renowned for its beautiful sunsets and
splendid salmon.</p>

<p>My aunt is artistic&mdash;she herself used to draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
when she was young&mdash;and I knew that nothing
would please her better, as a present from Holland,
than a number of carefully chosen water-colours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FILL IN THESE PAPERS.</div>

<p>Glowing with affectionate enthusiasm at the
prospect of giving my aunt so agreeable a surprise,
I made my way to the post-office and tried to send
off my package.</p>

<p>An obliging official addressed me in English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then&rdquo;, he said glancing at the address and
weighing my bundle in his hand, &ldquo;this will cost
you about six guilders if it goes as a letter, but,
if it is a book it will cost you two guilders and
a half. But as it appears to be neither a book nor
a letter, I should advise you to send it by &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">pakketpost</span>&rsquo;;
the cost will be under a guilder. Please fill
in these papers.&rdquo; And he reached me a dark red
paper and a flimsy white one both of which were
dotted all over with Dutch and French hard words
with spaces after them to be filled in.</p>

<p>I retired to a little desk and did my best,&mdash;stating
that I, Jack O&rsquo;Neill, aged so and so, sent
one brown package of expensive water-colour
pictures, some pencil-sketches and one pen-and-ink
drawing, value unknown, to Miss Rebecca
Fitzgerald O&rsquo;Neill, (<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">zonder beroep</span>), Warlin Castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Killery Bay, Ireland, on the 21st of Aug., 19&mdash;.
I added some other things here and there in the
columns and gave this report to the official. &ldquo;Not in
order,&rdquo; he said politely, &ldquo;you must put stamps on
the package, with wax.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">SEALING-WAX.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Stamps,&rdquo; he added, touching it all round, &ldquo;sealed
with sealing wax.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Sorry to give you so
much trouble. Many thanks!&rdquo; And I carried my
bundle to a neighbouring stationer&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The stationer was not at home, and his temporary
assistant was a youth that did not know English;
but I borrowed an Engelsch-Hollandsch WoordenBoek
from him and instituted a search for <em>wax</em>. After
some little trouble occasioned by the words &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">was</span>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">honigraat</span>&rsquo;, I settled down comfortably on the word
&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">lak</span>&rsquo;; and then the stationer&rsquo;s boy and I got on
quite nicely together. He helped me most willingly,
and made all sorts of suggestions. We secured a
candle and constructed two great seals, of red wax,
as if was for the Lord Chancellor; and I returned
to the Post-Office triumphant.</p>

<p>There was a new &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ambtenaar</span>&rsquo; on duty, the
English-speaking one having apparently gone to
luncheon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">NOT RIGHT YET.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mag ik beleefd verzoeken?</span>&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Zeker in
orde?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nee mijnheer</span>&rdquo;, he replied &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">volstrekt niet in
orde! Er moeten vijf zegels op zijn&mdash;vijf.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bundle seemed safe enough to go half round
the world! But he knew the rules; and I submitted
accordingly, went back to the stationer and put
five more seals on the packet, thus making the
number seven in all.</p>

<p>On presenting my carefully prepared &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">pakje</span>&rsquo; in
the post-office I felt confident enough that it was
right. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nu, mijnheer, het is zeker klaar?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The functionary was also disposed to think that
all was as it ought to be and seemed at first to
be satisfied.</p>

<p>He nodded approval; and gave me a friendly
official smile; but suddenly&mdash;as he was laying
the curious object aside&mdash;his eye caught the seal
I had used, and his face fell. The seal was a very
simple affair, having been impressed from the back
of a guilder&mdash;a beautiful new specimen that I
was reserving for show when I should return to
Trinity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">READ IT BACKWARDS.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nee, mijnheer</span>&rdquo;, he said sharply. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Heelemaal
niet goed! Het moet een werkelijk zegel zijn&mdash;met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
letters&mdash;Uw naam!</span>&rdquo; And he drew imaginary
initials on the blotting-paper with his thumb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Neen maar!&mdash;Mijnheer!</span>&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>Words failed to come to my relief. I could think of
nothing to say but &ldquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Gunst!</i>&rdquo; and in the circumstances
this sounded too like a curse to venture
upon. Presently however I recalled something under
cover of which I could retire: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het spijt mij erg&mdash;ik
ben verbaasd&mdash;dank u vriendlijk.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went away sincerely regretting that I had begun
this business at all. Fortunately when I hunted up
the stationer once more, the man himself was at
home; and after infinite rummaging in remote
drawers he got me a seal with the letters N.&nbsp;J.,&mdash;which
was a trifle like Jack O&rsquo;Neill, if you read it
backwards.</p>

<p>As that was the nearest approach I could get
to my initials, and as no time was to be lost,
we melted down another stick of red sealing-wax,
and stamped the package over with seven gigantic
seals, N.&nbsp;J.</p>

<p>I put on <em>seven</em>, though the official only demanded
five, for I had an undefined fear that something
would be wrong again. Meantime the &lsquo;get up&rsquo; of
the parcel was growing more impressive and unusual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
The effect of the big letters of the seal was
specially fine, the red bundle now looking as if it
were bound for New Jersey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAN I NEVER SEND OFF THIS PARCEL?</div>

<p>Then in fear and trembling I made for the post-office
again.</p>

<p>My tormentor appeared to be appeased. Ah yes,
at last the letters were all right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Uitstekend, mijnheer</span>,&rdquo; he said. And he quite
beamed upon me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nu de formulieren, asjeblieft.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, the papers, of course! I had quite forgotten
about them by this time. Fortunately I hadn&rsquo;t lost
them; so I handed him both documents. He took
them up, smiling benignly on the foreigner who had
managed to surmount so many obstacles; but alas!
his satisfaction&mdash;and mine too&mdash;were of short
duration. He frowned impatiently at the brown paper.
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nee, mijnheer</span>,&rdquo; he growled; &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">niet goed!</span>&rdquo; And he
pushed papers and package and all to me, as if he
was mortally offended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">H√©, mijnheer!</span>&rdquo; I ejaculated&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hoe is dat?
Kom toch! Wat is niet goed?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Geen zegel! geen zegel!</span>&rdquo; he thundered magisterially,
with a contemptuous toss of the brown
<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">formulier</i> in my direction. Like a shot he turned to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
schoolboy of fourteen at my elbow, (who had meantime
been studying my writings and reading them audibly
to his companions)&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">En U?</span>&rdquo; he enquired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A LONG CUE.</div>

<p>I felt dismissed, if not disgraced! And no investigation
of my belongings could throw any light
on my blunder. The brown manuscript was at fault
I knew; so, as the best thing possible I entered
a solemn declaration, opposite the hiernevens, &ldquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">een
pakje met 7 zegels</i>&rdquo;, and booked the same remark
on a convenient spot on the white paper. This done,
I returned to the charge promptly, but with much
inward apprehension. The cue of people pushing forward
to buy stamps and send things away and
generally to transact business, had grown to a long
line nearly to the door. Humbly I took my place
at the end of the file, about twenty minutes off the
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ambtenaar</span>. It wasn&rsquo;t quite twenty minutes, but it
felt longer; for every now and then the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ambtenaar</span>
glanced up, when he had served a customer, and
his eye invariably fell on me. It was a long-drawn-out
agony, that approach to the <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">loket</i>, under official
inspection, so to speak; and I had plenty of time
to register a silent bet with myself that the authorities
were not done with me. They&rsquo;d be sure to give me
another journey to the stationer&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ALLEMAAL ZEGELS.</div>

<p>And so they did! Without deigning to look at
my official guarantee about the 7 <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">zegels</i> the Postal
Radamanthus began with vitriolic self-restraint: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik&mdash;heb&mdash;U&mdash;gezegd.
Er&mdash;moet&mdash;een zegel&mdash;op.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Oh mynheer!</span>&rdquo; I burst out in hot indignation,
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hoe <em>kunt</em> U dat zeggen? Kijk! Het is allemaal
zegels!</span>&rdquo; And indeed the parcel was almost completely
coated with wax.</p>

<p>A spasm passed over his face, and he controlled
himself by a severe effort. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik&mdash;heb&mdash;U&mdash;al&mdash;meer
maal&mdash;gezegd</span>&rdquo;&mdash;His voice rose
higher and higher, and he bit off the words as if
they were poison. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hier moet de afdruk van het
zegel komen.&mdash;Hierr!</span>&rdquo; And he waved a white
hand over the coloured <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">formulier</i> and finally dropped
his thumb, like a pancake, over a lozenge-shaped
diagram filled with Dutch and French words. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hier!!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah yes! Just so. Now I saw what was wanted,
and I departed speechlessly to the sealing-wax-shop
again.</p>

<p>By this time I was quite domesticated there: so
I took a good rest and then put on a formidable
seal on the lozenge. In half an hour I was back
again on the premises of Rhadamanthus, at the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of another cue, wondering if I could reach the <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">loket</i>
before it would be closed for the day. You see all
that marching to and fro, and arguing with officials,
and cooking sealing-wax, and waiting your turn in
a crowd, swallows up an immensity of time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ART CRITICISM REJECTED.</div>

<p>At last I was before the little window and handed
in the documents. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, ja. De zegel is in orde!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">In orde</i>, <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">mijnheer</span>!&rdquo; he added with a cherubic
smile. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Best.</span>&rdquo; &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Maar&mdash;maar wat hebben we
hier?</span>&rdquo; he muttered as he perused my other remarks
on the papers. He appeared somewhat nonplussed
by my <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">opmerkingen</i> as to the contents of package,
and ran his pen through all my art criticisms; then
suddenly said roughly. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Heet U Rebecca O&rsquo;Neill?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was so unexpected a query that it threw me
off my guard and I answered in English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I hate her? Oh no. On the contrary, I am
sincerely attached to her. But why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Exkuseer</span>&rdquo; and called another <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ambtenaar</span>&mdash;one
who talked English. This new functionary
opened fire at once, &ldquo;Sir, is your name Rebecca
O&rsquo;Neill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless my heart&rdquo;, I said; &ldquo;Not at all. That&rsquo;s
my aunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case, sir, you have sent the package<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to yourself, and filled in the declarations all wrongly&rdquo;.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OF NO VALUE.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Is there <em>no</em> way,&rdquo; I said in despair, &ldquo;to send
this thing off? I have been all morning labouring
at it, and I can&rsquo;t get rid of it. Would you mind
accepting it as a gift&mdash;just a little friendly gift,
you know, as a token of my appreciation of the
post-office arrangements? Or would there be any
objection to my leaving it here lying on your desk?
It&rsquo;s quite harmless; perhaps even elegant&mdash;that
depends on taste&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t care for it any
more! It&rsquo;s no further use to me. Will you have it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Oh h√©!</span> you mean it is of no value?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No value&mdash;not the least&rdquo;, I said, glad to
see a chance of disposing of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you can send it off as, well&mdash;what we
call&mdash;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Monster zonder waarde</i>&mdash;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">monster&mdash;monster</span>&mdash;I
remember not your English word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is all right as it is. You don&rsquo;t
need it translated. &lsquo;Monster&rsquo; is quite good English&mdash;and
very expressive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;that is it&mdash;<em>Worthless
Monster</em>. <em>That</em> must you write&mdash;on the package.
Then will it cost you a <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">dubbeltje</span>; and it will go
off at once. No wax will be needed, and no papers.
No trouble of any kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">MONSTER ZONDER WAARDE.</div>

<p>&ldquo;I am delighted with your kindness,&rdquo; said I to
him. &ldquo;You have relieved my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you put the name on it now?&rdquo; he enquired
courteously, reaching me his own pen from behind
his ear. &ldquo;Please write legibly the English declaration.
I shall do the Dutch for you. It must be plain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;as you are so kind,
might I ask you just to write both English and
Dutch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A glance had shown me that these curious words
would have to come uncomfortably near my aunt&rsquo;s
name; and as my aunt is rather a particular old
lady with very definite notions about her own dignity,
I judged it prudent that this title of distinction
with which she was going to be invested should be
drawn up in other handwriting than her nephew&rsquo;s.
She had a hawk&rsquo;s eye and could detect every
scratch I made with the pen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not too much trouble, please put the
whole declaration on it yourself. You&rsquo;ll find a place
here&rdquo;, I said, turning over the unsightly object.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little room left here, I think&mdash;just
beside the address&rdquo;.</p>

<p>He looked it all over. It was quite true. The
parcel was all a mass of red wax and &ldquo;N.&nbsp;J.&rsquo;s&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
except round about the address, where we had kept
the wax well off it for fear of infringing some other
regulation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FLATTERING ADDRESS.</div>

<p>&ldquo;English first!&rdquo; he said, making use of the vacant
space.</p>

<p>And in Roman letters just after my aunt&rsquo;s name
he boldly penned the mystic words, first in English,
and then, in brackets, in Dutch. This is how it ran:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="bbox1">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">To Miss REBECCA FITZGERALD O&rsquo;NEILL</span>,</p>

<p class="spr2"><span class="f8"><b>Worthless Monster (<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">zonder waarde</span>),</b></span></p>

<p class="spr7"><span class="smcap">Warlin castle,</span></p>

<p class="spr2">KILLERY BAY</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ireland</span>      <span class="conn">CONNEMARA.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>After that I wouldn&rsquo;t touch the parcel.</p>

<p>I declined all further responsibility in connection
with it; and, leaving it with him, retired,
as from a good day&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>As I knew my aunt, I felt sure she would appreciate
the delicate compliment implied by the
proximity of the postal notice to her name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IS CHIVALRY DEAD?</div>

<p>This indeed proved the case, when I visited her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
later in the autumn. I draw a veil over our interview;
but happily my aunt is fond of a joke, and
when I told her my adventures of that morning,
she laughed as she had not done for years, until I
flattered myself she had forgotten the queer declaration
on her package.</p>

<p>At the end, however, she suddenly drew herself
up and, raising a reproving finger, said, &ldquo;Well,
it wasn&rsquo;t <em>your</em> writing! or I shouldn&rsquo;t let you off so
easily, Jack. But what kind of a functionary was
that, now, who would dare, in your presence, to
insult your aunt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my young days a lad of spirit would have
<em>called out</em> a villain like that,&mdash;yes, or a fellow
that ventured on the twentieth part of such an
atrocity!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack, Jack, where&rsquo;s your chivalry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself, my dear aunt,&rdquo; I retorted.
&ldquo;Its only that you don&rsquo;t catch the niceties of a
translation. But you&rsquo;ll pick that up soon enough if
you go over with me to the Hague next year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Never</em>&rdquo;, said my aunt firmly.</p>

<small>A SUCCESSFUL INTERVIEW.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;You must not suppose,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Neill, after I
had expressed my commiseration, &ldquo;that I was always
unsuccessful in my conversations and business transactions.
On the contrary I have sometimes surprised
myself and everybody else by the (shall I say?)
aptness and readiness of my utterance&mdash;not to
speak of its delicacy and point.</p>

<p>You smile? But listen.</p>

<p>This was certainly the case one day when I
had an interview with an elegant young man
who came to me from the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Bevolkings Register
Bureau</span>.</p>

<p>That is the place where the authorities give
themselves so much needless trouble about your
address and initials, and where I had broken the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
law of the land by mixing up the tinsmith with
the lightning-conductor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KEEP THE CONVERSATION TO YOURSELF.</div>

<p>Well a representative of this Departement of
State called upon me two days running, when I
was out. The last time he came he left word that
he would return next morning at 10.30 sharp;
and would I please give him an interview?</p>

<p>I thought it wise to do so.</p>

<p>That unhappy blunder of mine might get me
into trouble. Perhaps the officials of the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Bevolkings</span>
office were going to prosecute me for conspiring
to deceive the government. At all events I
would be at home at 10.30; and, more than that,
I would be ready for my visitor when he came.</p>

<p>I rose about six, and prepared for the proposed
conversation as a barrister prepares his brief.</p>

<p>As the man who talks most has generally the
situation in his own hand, I determined to keep the
greater part of the conversation to myself. All
the likely sentences that could possibly be of
avail I copied out of the phrase-book on a sheet of
foolscap. Some new expressions and idioms were
added, and committed as thoroughly as possible to
memory.</p>

<p>And, by the way, I made use of a fresh discovery&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
number of <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">algemeene opmerkingen</i> from the end of
the grammar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A LITERARY FORTRESS.</div>

<p>These were on the same lines as the material
in the phrase-book, but much more learned. They
were for advanced students (I was rather advanced
now, so to speak,) and they had a distinct literary
and scientific flavour. I went over all these,
aloud&mdash;my old and favourite plan&mdash;so as to gain
fluency and facility in uttering them.</p>

<p>Furthermore, not being able to trust my memory
absolutely&mdash;there was a lot of new stuff to be
mastered, you see,&mdash;I hit upon a plan to lead the
conversation and keep it upon topics of my own
choosing.</p>

<p>My strategem was of uncommon simplicity, but
admirably effective for all that.</p>

<p>On my table I erected a kind of informal reading-desk
composed of books and magazines; then
in a hollow of this edifice, out of sight, I placed my
manuscript notes where they could easily catch my
eye. Two chairs I set carefully in position&mdash;one
for myself beside my fortress, the other for my
visitor in the middle of the room in a good clear
light.</p>

<p>Then I awaited results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">AN ASTONISHED OFFICIAL.</div>

<p>At half past ten o&rsquo;clock sharp there came a
ring to the hall-door; and, ushered by the obsequious
landlady, in walked a young fellow fashionably
dressed, with languid manners and a general
air being bored with life. He carried a portfolio
gracefully under his arm.</p>

<p>Without waiting for him to begin, I went up
to him the moment he entered, and shook him
cordially by the hand, I relieved him of his umbrella&mdash;he
had one though the weather was fine;
and as his other hand was thus partially released,
I shook it with no less heartiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Blijdschap, mijnheer!</span>&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Blijdschap en
vreugde! Het verblijdt mij zeer&mdash;U te ontmoeten!
Mag ik U verzoeken Uw jas af te zetten. Wat?
Nee?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the day was burning hot and he wore no
overcoat, I didn&rsquo;t insist upon this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Zij het zoo, myn waarde!&mdash;Neem een stoel</span>,&rdquo;
I continued. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ga zitten, ik bid U. Het is aangenaam
weer.&mdash;Volstrekt niet koud&mdash;neen&mdash;niet
koud.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was well within the mark, for it was 89¬∞
in the shade.</p>

<p>My Dutch seemed to surprise him for he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
feebly &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Dag</span>&mdash;Sir&mdash;Yes&mdash;I mean&mdash;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">O ja</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">WAT GEBRUIKT U?</div>

<p>I saw he was just the kind of young man that
I could have a pleasant talk with. But it was now
time I got back to my notes. Before sitting down
however, I asked to take charge of his hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Handig mij Uw hoed over!</span>&rdquo; I said, reaching for it.
When he hesitated, I put him at his ease with
an &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">alstjeblieft; toe dan! toe!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though there was an interval of a second or two
whilst I was getting behind my barricade he was
too astonished to utter a sound, either in Dutch or
in English. I perceived my advantage and intended
to keep it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mag ik u iets aanbieden?</span>&rdquo; I said with a wave
of the hand, throwing in some nonsense out the
grammar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wat gebruikt U?&mdash;ah&mdash;hm&mdash;Een&mdash;<em>voorzetsel</em>,
bijvoorbeeld?&mdash;of&mdash;de gebiedende wijs&mdash;of&mdash;een
bijvoeglijk naamwoord? Wat&mdash;niets?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he still said nothing, I pointed him to my
cupboards, by happy inspiration remembering the
refrain of the vendor of eatables at one of the
stations, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Bierr, limonade, spuitwater?</span>&rdquo; adding&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Bitterkoekjes
en ijskoud bier; of&mdash;een
amandel broodje?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">IK BID U WELKOM.</div>

<p>It was well he didn&rsquo;t accept, for I had none
of these dainties in the house; but it sounded
friendly to offer them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Of</span>,&rdquo; I put in, sinking my voice to a confidential
whisper, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Spreekt U liever over de Nieuwe
Electrische Tramweg? Wel, dan.&mdash;Het publiek
wordt gewaarschuwd het personeel niet in gesprek
te houden.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very faintly came the reply, as he moved restlessly
on the edge of his chair, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mynheer, ik kwam
niet om de Tramweg.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Neen?</span>&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Goed. Best. Ik neem het ook
niet kwalijk, mijnheer! ik bid U welkom!&mdash;Het
doet mij genoegen, na al het ongunstige weer van
verleden week, U zoo goed en wel te zien.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The weather had been quite hot; but this was one
of the good phrases of the book, and I stuck to it.</p>

<p>All this appeared to increase his panic, and he
glanced at the door more than once as if he would
like to make a bolt for safety.</p>

<p>Now I was quite in my element, and from my
palissade of books I could hurl all sorts of irrelevant
politenesses at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik verwelkom U oprechtelijk, mijnheer. U bezoek
is mij oorzaak van ongeveinsde blijdschap.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">NONSENSE LET LOOSE.</div>

<p>Holding the portfolio clenched in both hands he
stared at me as if he was incapable of speech.</p>

<p>This seemed a favourable opportunity for putting
in an <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">algemeene opmerking</i>, which I must say had
all the effect of a round shot after infantry fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Deugden en belooning gaan zelden te zamen</span>,&rdquo;
I murmured pleasantly, with a friendly gesture of
deprecation. Then in a second or two afterwards
I added,&mdash;leaving him to find out the connection
as best he might,&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Water bevriest op
twee-en-dertig graden.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The more outrageous the nonsense which I
repeated from my notes, the paler he got.</p>

<p>He seemed to measure the distance between his
seat and the door; but I rose and walked about the
room, repeating softly to myself such phrases as
I knew well, no matter what meaning they might
have&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Lamaar! pas op! niet pluis, hoor!&mdash;&rsquo;t
komt er niet op aan!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some midges were buzzing about the room. I
pointed to them saying &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">akelige beesten, nie waar?</span>&rdquo;
And making a sudden spring towards one that was
approaching his head I impaled it, or rather smashed
it, in the approved fashion between my hands.
The fragments of the insect I displayed to him on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
my palm adding triumphantly; &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Dood als een pier.</span>&rdquo;
He was ready to go.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A LINGUISTIC VICTORY.</div>

<p>Laying at last a fatherly hand upon his shoulder
I genially enquired, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Vergun my te vragen,
jongeling,&mdash;hoe is het&mdash;met uwe&mdash;achtenswaardige
ouders?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">O ja, mijnheer</span>&rdquo;, he said in a breathless whisper.
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja zeker, mijnheer. Dank U zeer&mdash;Ik moet weg,
sir. Ik heb belet&mdash;thuis&mdash;Ik moet weg&mdash;Ik
zal het U zenden.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>And he was gone! gone, too, without his hat!</p>

<p>I was left master of the field.</p>

<p>Ringing the bell, I rushed to the landing and
called after him, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Duizendmaal vergiffenis, Bevolkings
Mijnheer!&mdash;Uw hoed!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>But that hurried him only the more swiftly down
those steep stairs; and I was sincerely glad to
observe that the landlady, like a good goal-keeper,
had stopped him at the door, where they entered
into earnest colloquy.</p>

<p>I had won this conversational contest; and half
my ammunition was not yet expended!</p>

<p>Eight polite sentences and about a dozen &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">algemeene
opmerkingen</span>&rsquo; remained unused, besides two
general topics&mdash;&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">boomkweekerij</span>&rsquo; and <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Rembrandt</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">HOUD UWEN BEK.</div>

<p>But what did he mean by &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik zal het U zenden</span>?&rsquo;
What was it that he meant to send? I devoutly
hoped there would be no further difficulty about
my address, and was just trusting I had escaped,
when the landlady entered with the words, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hij
moet zijn hoed hebbe</span>.&rdquo; Then, as she took it in
her hand, she added &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer zegt, dat het niet
veilig in huis is&mdash;niet veilig, zegt mijnheer!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hij vraagt ook wat de groote letter is v√≥√≥r
O&rsquo;Neill? Of het een J of een I of een T of een
F of een Y is, niemand op het kantoor kan het
uitmaken, Uw handschrift is zoo onduidelijk, zegt
mijnheer.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Relieved to see there was nothing worse, I went
to some old copies of the &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nieuws van den Dag</span>,&rsquo;
which were lying carefully folded up on the side-table,
and with a pair of scissors cut out a J from the word
Juli, pasted it hastily on a sheet of notepaper and
wrote underneath it, &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Met veel complimenten&mdash;en
de groeten.</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yes; the interview was decidedly successful.</p>

<p>Yet it pales before the fame I once got by a
single sentence, just outside de <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Beurs-station</span>, in
Rotterdam.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STILL MUCH ADMIRED.</div>

<p>I was pounced upon by an army of porters; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
had seized me and my bag, and were quarrelling
loudly. I said &ldquo;Hush&rdquo; to the worst of them, but
one brawny rascal was inclined to be insolent, and
I was put upon my mettle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik bid U&mdash;houd Uwen bek</span>,&rdquo; I said&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">anders</span>,&rdquo;&mdash;and
here I glanced round for a policeman,
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">anders&mdash;roep ik&mdash;de Openbare Macht</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man ran like a hare.</p>

<p>I pride myself that there was dignity and firmness,
courtesy and local colour all in that one sentence.</p>

<p>And I find that it is still much admired.</p>

<small>DUTCH CORRESPONDENCE.</small></h2>


<p>The gentleman from the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Bevolkings Register
Bureau</span> had left his umbrella behind him in his hurried
departure that Thursday morning, so I sent it
back to him with a polite note. It would have been
easy to write the polite note in English, but that
would never do. After my success in carrying on a
long conversation in Dutch I felt that a lapse into
English would be a confession of weakness.</p>

<p>My reputation as a linguist could only be maintained
by a real Dutch letter. Now the phrase book
gave but little light on the vast subject of correspondence.
Except a brief note acknowledging the
arrival of a ton of coals, and a still briefer note
accepting, in the third person, a formal invitation
to dinner, there was nothing about letter-writing in
the volume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">DIERBARE HOOGEDELGESTRENGE.</div>

<p>It was not easy to find any phrases out of these
epistles suitable for working in to my note about
the umbrella.</p>

<p>They were valuable as examples, merely for the
general rhythm and style, as it were, and then only
to a slight extent. As my missive was of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genre</i>
quite distinct from these models, I felt justified in
composing it in my own way.</p>

<p>I wrote the letter first in English; then set about
translating it, as elegantly as I could, into Dutch.</p>

<p>Here is the English&mdash;quite friendly, you see.</p>

<p class="spl6"><i>Dear Sir</i>,</p>

<p><i>As you left your umbrella behind on Thursday
morning when you did me the honour to call, I
beg to send it to you by bearer, in the hope that
it may reach you safely without delay.</i></p>

<p><i>Trusting that its absence may have occasioned
you no inconvenience, I remain, dear sir,</i></p>

<p class="right">
<span class="spr4"><i>Very truly yours</i></span><br />
<span class="spr1"><i>Jack O&rsquo;Neill</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>As a beginning, the phrase-book gave <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hooggeachte
Heer</span> and <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hoogedelgestrenge Heer</span>, and many
more very official-looking titles. It gave &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">mijnheer</span>&rsquo;
for &lsquo;sir&rsquo;; but for &lsquo;dear sir&rsquo; nothing at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">HET BY MIJ EENE VISITE AFLEGGEN.</div>

<p>Seeing, however, that <em>dear</em> was <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">lief</em> or <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">dierbaar</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
I could easily make out a form of friendly address:&mdash;&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Dierbare
mijnheer</span>&rsquo; or briefly &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Dierbaar</span>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was a toss up, indeed whether to take the
stiff title <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hooggeachte Heer</span> (for <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hoogedelgestrenge
Heer</span> seemed too much of a good thing for a note
about an umbrella) or this more affectionate but
somewhat doubtful <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Dierbaar</span>!</p>

<p>I finally decided on a combination, one at the
beginning and one at the end.</p>

<p>I sailed along quite comfortably until I arrived
at his &lsquo;<em>doing me the honour to call</em>&rsquo;. This required
hammering out; and when I had tortured
myself a long time over it, here is what I got:
&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">wanneer gij mij vereerdet door het bij mij eene
visite afleggen</span>&rsquo;. Dreadfully round-about, you perceive!
So I just fell back upon brevity, and trusted
to luck to carry me safely through. &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Op mij te
roepen</span>&rsquo;, sounded terse and likely; and I chose it to
avoid worse pitfalls with <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">door</em> and the infinitive.</p>

<p>As &lsquo;<em>I beg</em>&rsquo; had a brusque ring, I made it a
trifle mellower and more courteous by the helpful
and familiar &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">verschoon mij</span>&rsquo;. &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Verschoon mij, dat
ik bedel</span>,&rsquo; I could not improve on <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>But the proper division of &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">overhandigen</span>&rsquo; into its
component parts was not easy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">VERTROUWELIJK <span xml:lang="en" lang="en">OR</span> WAARACHTIG.</div>

<p>To get the right &lsquo;hang&rsquo; of this sentence, I forcibly
detached the &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">over</span>&rsquo;, and dragged this harmless <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">voorzetsel</span>
well forward so as not to impede the action
of its own particular verb, when you got so far.
This much improved the rhythm; and I gave myself
some freedom in the phrasing to keep up the style.</p>

<p>Indeed, after all, two or three bits of phrases
could be worked in. &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Goedige aanblikken</span>&rsquo; caught
my eye somewhere. I was delighted to have a kind
of equivalent for <em>kind regards</em>; and eschewing the
temptation to deviate into &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">zuiverlijk</span>&rsquo; for <em>sincerely</em>,
or &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">vertrouwelijk</span>&rsquo; for <em>faithfully</em>, I finished with
simple directness using &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">waarachtig</span>&rsquo; for <em>truly</em>. This
I afterwards thought of changing to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">waarempeltjes</span>
as being less formal.</p>

<p>Finally, to give a neat turn to the whole, I
dropped in a sentence from the conversation-manual,
so as to refer with a light but artistic touch to
the broiling weather.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FINISHED PRODUCT.</div>

<p>Thus the finished product assumed the following
form:</p>

<div lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">

<p>Aangezien dat gij in mijn zaal laatsten Donderdag

datum dat gij mij de eer deedt om op mij te roepen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
en visite af te leggen, verschoon mij dat ik bedel het
geabandoneerde voorwerp beleefd over aan UEdele
te handigen door den drager dezes briefs.</p>

<p>Ik bemerkt niet eerstelijk dat de regenscherm de
Uwe was; dus ik vertrouw dat gij wilt pardoneeren
al het verdriet dat zijne afwezigheid veroorzaakt
hebben moge.</p>

<p>Hoe heerlijk dat het gunstige weer van gisteren
en onlangs gestadig blijft! Ik hoop van harte dat
U ervan heerlijk geniet.</p>

<p>Koesterende den hoop dat de regenscherm zonder
oponthoud U goed en wel zal bereiken,</p>

<span class="spr6">Ik blijf,</span><br />

<p>Op hoogst geestige wijze vertelde de Heer <span class="smcap">Brown</span> van
des heeren O&rsquo;Neill onverstoorbaren ijver om Hollandsch
te willen spreken, en de honderden bokken, die de Brit
schoot, deden de toehoorders soms onbedaarlijk lachen,
vooral zijn kennismaking met den heer van het bevolkingsregisterbureau,
zijn onderhoud met de waschvrouw bij
het opmaken der waschlijst, zijn uitstapje naar den Haag,
de wijze waarop hij &ldquo;Have jou pens&rdquo; vertaalde, en de
manier waarop hij zich in verschillende winkels trachtte
duidelijk te maken waren hoogst amusant. Maar vooral
de teekening van hetgeen daarbij voorviel en was op te
merken, gaf ons humor te hooren, zooals we die slechts
vinden bij <span class="smcap">Dickens</span>.</p>

<p class="pers"><cite>Het Nieuws van Zeist en Driebergen.</cite></p>


<p>In de kleine zaal van het concertgebouw heeft de Heer
<span class="smcap">J. Irwin Brown</span>, die reeds den vorigen winter met groot
succes hier ter stede een paar lezingen hield, een volle
zaal vaak tot schier onbedaarlijk lachen gedwongen, door
zijn lezing. En de velen die hem hoorden en zich af en
toe tranen lachten, hebben den redenaar door warme
toejuichingen beloond voor het genot hun verschaft,</p>

<p class="pers"><cite>Alg. Handelsblad.</cite></p>


<p>De typische manier, waarop de Heer <span class="smcap">Brown</span> het Hollandsch
uitsprak, alsmede zijn kalm maar hoogst humoristische
wijze van voordragen &ldquo;deed &rsquo;t hem.&rdquo; De talrijke
aanwezigen gierden het telkens uit van &rsquo;t lachen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
sommige gevallen waren bepaald ook uiterst amusant.</p>

<p>Hun die nog niet het genoegen hadden de Heer <span class="smcap">Brown</span>
te hooren, kunnen wij zeer aanbevelen zulks te gaan doen.</p>

<p class="pers"><cite>Telegraaf.</cite></p>


<p>Behalve zijn liefde voor de Engelsche literatuur, bezit
de Heer <span class="smcap">Brown</span> ook den kostelijken humor die zoo speciaal
Britsch is, dien humor zonder eenige pretentie, maar
daarom juist zoo onweerstaanbaar.</p>

<p>Verslag te geven van deze voordracht is ondoenlijk.
Men moet die zelf hooren om mee te schateren van &rsquo;t
lachen.</p>

<p class="pers"><cite>Rotterdamsch Nieuwsblad.</cite></p>


<p>Dms. <span class="smcap">Brown</span> heeft ook ditmaal weder veel succes gehad
en wij zouden niet weten wat meer te prijzen: zijn
schoone &ldquo;dictie&rdquo; van verzen, of de geestige manier,
waarop hij &ldquo;a Briton&rsquo;s Difficulties in mastering Dutch&rdquo;
behandelde. Het laatste bracht de lachspieren heftig in
beweging en bij elken &ldquo;blunder&rdquo; van den Brit schaterde
het publiek het uit.</p>

<p>Van harte hopen wij, dat het Haarlemsche publiek het
volgend jaar nog eens in de gelegenheid zal worden
gesteld dezen begaafden spreker te hooren.</p>

<p class="pers"><cite>Haarlemsche Courant.</cite></p>


<p>&rdquo;... Aan velen in den lande zijn de stukjes, hier
in een bundel verzameld, reeds bekend, want de Heer
<span class="smcap">Brown</span> heeft ze op verschillende plaatsen voorgedragen.
In een aantal recensies van die voordrachten wordt gewag
gemaakt van het onbedaarlijk gelach, dat de voordrager
er mee verwekte. Het is ons bij de lezing niet anders
vergaan. We konden ons telkens niet houden van het<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
lachen. Het boekje is inderdaad vol onweerstaanbare vis
comica.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pers"><cite>Nieuwe Rotterd. Courant.</cite></p>


<p>... Van af de eerste tot de laatste bladzijde spreekt
er uit het boekje een schat van gezonden, ongezochten
humor, afgewisseld door tal van rake opmerkingen, over
misbruiken in onze spreektaal binnengeslopen en zoo geacclimatiseerd,
dat we ze nauwelijks meer bemerkten.
Zelfs <span class="smcap">Nurks</span> zaliger nagedachtenis zou het bezit van lachspieren
gemerkt hebben, wanneer hem ooit de conversatie
tusschen <span class="smcap">O&rsquo;Neill</span> en den heer van &rsquo;t bevolkingsregister
ware medegedeeld.</p>

<p>Als &rsquo;t waar is, dat lachen een genezenden invloed op
zieken uitoefent, wagen we &ldquo;An Irishman&rsquo;s difficulties
with the Dutch language&rdquo; als universeel-geneesmiddel aan
te bevelen, op gevaar af, ons schuldig te maken aan
onbevoegd uitoefenen der geneeskunde....</p>

<p class="pers"><cite>De Telegraaf.</cite></p>


<p>... Het is een boekje vooral geschikt voor kniesooren
en droefgeestigen. Ze zullen er van opknappen.</p>

<p class="pers"><cite>De Nederlander.</cite></p>


<p>... Laten ze lachen om het prachtige Hollandsche
waschlijstje, om den bliksemafleider en om de &ldquo;kwast&rdquo; in
het caf√©tje, allen tot mistificaties worden, lachen om
zooveel andere dingen, als de moeilijkheden met den postambtenaar,
bij het verzenden van een postpakketje of het
gesprek met den man van het bevolkingsregister, lachen
om het kostelijke briefje waarmee het boekje besluit....</p>
